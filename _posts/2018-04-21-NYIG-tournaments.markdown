title:  "NYIG Open Go Tournament"

I played the [New York Institute of Go](http://ny-go.org) tournament today. I'd written
previously about
[Stephanie Yin's school](http://swannodette.github.io/baduk//2016/11/17/go-friends.html). They've
since moved to a new location and this tournament was the inaugural
event. The new NYIG space is considerably larger and nicer than before
and I think that's pretty clear from the photos.

I drove to the tournament and arrived around 9:40am. Parking was
relatively easy as the surrounding area off the main street was
residential. As I was parking, I noticed quite a few faces from the
Mostly Go meetup walking up.

Inside I munched on a bagel I'd picked up for the excursion while chatting
with Andrew McGowan, a Mostly Go regular rapidly approaching
AGA 1 dan. Eventually the first pairings were called and my first round
was against a 7 kyu I'd been paired with in other tournaments.
I won decisively without any complications.

The second round was a considerably more challenging game against a 5
kyu. It was a long round and I felt evenly matched. The endgame was
played almost entirely in byo-yomi by both of us so it was probably a
bit sloppy. By the time we both passed I had no sense of who was
winning, I only knew that it was going to be incredibly close -
observers around the table agreed. After the tally, I was ahead by
just 3.5 points. Of all the rounds, this one was the most interesting
to me and I wish I'd recorded it.

After the second round there was a lunch break and I hung out in the
tournament room chatting with Andrew. There was another fellow with
him and we all decided to grab a bite to eat together. We walked next
door to a Turkish place and ordered a quick meal. I asked Andrew's
friend's name, he said Stephen. I asked him what his KGS handle was -
*Twprcntmlk*. I smiled, one of In-seong's students!

We immediately started talking about AYD and how much we loved
it. This was the first time I'd ever met a fellow AYDer in the flesh
before! We all knew we were in good company and the conversation
flowed naturally towards all things Go. It sounded like both Stephen
and Andrew would be making the Stonybrook tournament in a couple of
weeks. I asked them if they were planning on attending US Go
Congress - and they both thought it would be unlikely. We talked
Hikaru No Go and our favorites pro before rushing to pay the bill to
get back for rounds 3 and 4.

Round 3 was against a 10 kyu. This was a 3 stone handicap game. As the
game progressed it became increasingly obvious that my opponent was
not a 10 kyu. I won by sheer luck as my opponent ran out of
time. Afterwards my opponent admitted he was a KGS 7 kyu. Given that
I'm technically a KGS 3 kyu maybe the handicap was fair after
all. However, the more I play tournaments the more I think that
tournament anxiety and tournament time controls work very effectively
as a leveler. Perhaps this is yet another reminder that ranks don't
amount to much and one should stay focused on learning.

The final round was a two stone game against a 3 kyu. I
started off quite well in the opening, but I failed to reinforce a
weak group and the remainder of the game was a long struggle. While
this wasn't the most interesting game, it was a good reminder that simple
mistakes can easily ruin a game that's going pretty well.

Still I ended the tournament 3-1, so I didn't have much to complain
about. While everyone waited for the boards to finish, I listened in
on Stephen's review. His opponent was another AYDer, Howard. It's hard
not to smile widely when listening to two players happily go over a game
and recount the story.

Awards were given out and I said my farewells. I had to head out a bit
early, but I said that if we ever ended up in NYIG again together we
should definitely recount our victories and losses over a delicious
Flushing Korean meal.
