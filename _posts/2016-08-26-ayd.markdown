On a whim, a week ago I decided to sign up for the 16th season of
[In-seong Hwang's American Yunguseng Dojang](http://ayd.yunguseng.com)
(AYD). This [insei](http://senseis.xmp.net/?Insei) style online school
came up in several conversations at US Go Congress and much of the
sentiment expressed was very positive. After my fantastic experience
at the US Go Congress, AYD's round robin tournament format with longer
game time controls combined with lectures and weekly reviews really
resonates with me. I signed up to try it out for a month with the
intention of sticking around for the whole season if it goes well.

It wasn't clear that I would be able to get in since AYD is structured
around leagues and each league must have at least six players. When I
signed up there wasn't quite enough people to fill out an additional
league. Still I was given access to the video lectures which I started
going through and I must say I'm very impressed by their quality. So I
crossed my fingers guessed that in the worst case I could stick around
as an observer for the season. 

However, just yesterday I got an email saying I made it in! I'll
definitely be writing about my first month in AYD here so stay tuned.
