Once again unto the breach! Today my opponent was a 6 kyu. This
pairing was particular interesting since it was someone I knew from
[Life in 19x19](http://lifein19x19.com), a really fantastic forum for
go players.

My opponent was tough and I tried as hard as I could to
follow the principles that Kevin demonstrated the past two
evenings. As you might have predicted I ran my clock down to the last
byo-yomi. This was another very a close game
that I almost lost control of due to a blunder that put a whole group of
stones into a unfavorable life and death situation. By some kind of
miracle my opponent didn't see the move that I thought would pretty much kill
the group and I was able to salvage the stones. With that near miss
behind, we went into endgame where I was able to eke out the
points I needed for the win. I won the game by 8.5.

My opponent and I agreed to meet at 12:55pm for a review with Stephanie Yin
at 1pm. I found Ien and headed to lunch.

# Lunch

We hopped on over the Beijin Cafe yet again. It really is a decent
bite and if you get there around noon then you can sit down almost
immediately. The service is also quite quick which was nice since we
wanted to get back for the reviews. While we ate we chatted about our
games - Ien lost his. Ien entered the congress at self-declared 15 kyu
and ended up winning his first two games and losing his third. Live Go
is still a new thing for him so in many ways he's still getting his
bearings (I am too of course but I play more regularly at Mostly Go).

We wolfed down our lunch and headed back for the pro reviews.

# Pro Review

My opponent and I were third in line for Stephanie Yin's reviews. She didn't
comment too much on the opening, she said it was "just like the
pros". Ha! As we moved into the middle game she had pointers here and
there about specific moves and less about direction of play. Things
didn't get really interesting until my opponent's very sharp move
at 63. She immediately saw the killing potential of black 73 at J17
after white extends at H16. Of course I got lucky and the game
transitioned into the end game. I was only able to record to move 114
due to being in byo-yomi, but we both mostly had questions
about the first half of the game anyhow.

After the review I poked my head into Feng Yun's invasion lecture but
I was a bit too unfocused today to stick around. Downstairs I spotted
Nathan and a friend in a Rengo game which I observed for a little
while. Nathan's side won. When they wandered off I took a second to
work on a blog post and Brady Daniels came by to say hello. We
chatted about our US Open games - he lost to Keith Arnold
today. There was a critical move that Brady missed so we
joined some of his friends to go through a fairly fast review.

Once Brady showed the move and the consequences it was pretty clear
that it would have been a game changer. I asked if he was going to
record a Brady's Blunder episode about it and he said
absolutely. Watching dans review a game is still a bit too fast paced
for me but the friendliness that everyone shows certainly makes the
experience a whole lot less intimidating.

I had to head out before the end of the review as Ien had arranged a
dinner get together with the OGS developers.

# Dinner 

We walked down to the pizza spot from the first day and shared some
tasty slices and a couple of beers. The OGS folks were incredibly nice
and incredibly enthusiastic. We talked a lot about the state of online Go
and I think the OGS folks are doing many of the right things to
attract newcomers into the fold. While I don't think much can be done
about the entrenchment of IGS, KGS, Tygem, etc. for serious players, I
do think there's still an incredible opportunity to build friendlier
platforms for people who are just beginning their journey into the
land of Go.

Around 6:50pm we headed back to the congress venue for Pair Go and the
Evening League.

# Pair Go & Evening League

As we walked into the main hall, Pair Go was just getting started. Ien
made a quick dash into the other room to get a Evening League game in
but I stuck around to observe. Many pairs were dressed up for the
event and quite a few pros were participating. Once the games were
underway I did a quick walk around to scope out the boards before
going next door to observe Ien's game.

Ien was playing a game with a fellow named Shawn, and Harry was
playing a game with fellow whose name escapes me. I also saw Ethan
playing a game as well. I thought about playing but instead I wandered
around between these boards. I spent a particularly long time on Ien's
board since I originally taught him Go, and I try to give him what
tips and principles I can for my level.

Ien's friend Nassos stopped by around 9pm. Nassos also brought a
friend who had never played go before. I ended up demonstrating the
basic rules of the game. After that we went next door to browse the
various Pair Go games underway. On Stephanie Yin's board where her side was
playing white, we noticed a black stone placed on the 1-1 point which
seemed quite strange (I ended up getting an answer about that from
Stephanie the following day).

After Nassos's friend took off, the three of us sat down to review
Ien's game. There were some very simple things that I wanted to cover
and the review had the side effect of getting Nassos really excited
about the game. Even though he's just learned how to play he could see
the dramatic "twists and shakes" that make the game of Go so thrilling.

After the review we grabbed a night cap at a nice cocktail spot near
our AirBnB. The evening air was pleasant and I don't even remember
what we talked about, I just recall feeling pretty content.

Eventually we headed back to rest. I'm 3-1 so far and hoping to seize
4-1 tomorrow.
