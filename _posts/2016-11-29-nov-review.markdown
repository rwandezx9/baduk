I've really stepped up the amount of play this month. Between my
Yunguseng games and my KGS games, I've managed to play 19 thoughtful
games and win 69% of them! While I suffered a short streak of
disappointing losses this past weekend, I was able turn myself around to
barely cling onto KGS 5 kyu. I'm unlikely to get anymore games in this
month since I'm about to travel a bit for work, so I've
started outlining a couple of goals for December. American Yunguseng
will be on winter break, so having a plan to keep the momentum going
seems important.

The obvious and probably over-ambitious goal is that I'd like to graze
KGS 4 kyu by the end of December. A less lofty one is to address an
aspect of my play that I now see as a weakness - I play too slow in the
opening. This isn't to say I'm going to start blitzing or anything -
but this bad habit means I always end up rushing through the last 100
moves under the pressure of byo-yomi. I find myself blundering through
tricky middle game fights because my clock just doesn't have the time
required for close reading, and I often find myself getting lucky
because my opponent follows my misread with their own misread (I find
that very few opponents ever use more than 10 or 15 minutes of their
time during the whole game even if they have 25).

But in order for me to handle these middle game skirmishes in a
deliberate way, I need to spend less time in the opening. In order to
play more quickly in the opening, I need to be more confident. In order
to be more confident, I need to spend more time studying opening
patterns and basic opening theory. Fortunately In-seong has ample
material for me to digest. My openings are getting faster but there's
still a lot more work to do.

# What I'm Studying

While I've been repeatedly singing the praises of Cho Hun-hyun's
Lectures, I recently was inspired to browse the final chapter of Yilun
Yang's book The Fundamental Principles of Go. This chapter covers typical
invasion/reduction patterns. Over the summer I found all the
variations baffling and doubted that I could ever make sense of
it. However after all the time spent on Cho Hun-hyun and In-seong's
material, surprise - Yilun Yang's variations suddenly seemed
considerably less daunting. I immediately sat down at the goban and
started going through all the variations, trying to both memorize and
really understand.

The other thing I've been looking closely at is Shusaku vs. Shuwa
(1851-1852) from Invincible. Considered a masterpiece, I've found this
one of the most enjoyable Shusaku game records to memorize. The game
doesn't have complex fighting, jaw dropping exchanges, or game
swinging kos. Shusaku and Shuwa play with a clarity and efficiency
that's stunning to behold - you can feel the game naturally transition
from opening, middle and into endgame. While it's certainly the case
that after memorizing a couple of games, it gets easier - with this
game it feels less like memorizing, it almost seems obvious where the
next move must be!

As much as I love playing my own games, there's a particular pleasure
to replaying the moves of masters. It's an aspect of Baduk that I
never suspected I would enjoy quite this much and I'm glad it's a part
of my approach to the game.
