I finally broke through to KGS 3 kyu yesterday. One small tweak that
I've made to my fast game training regimen is that I play weak bots as
well with a handicap of one more stone than the rank gap. While I
enjoy these fast games, I'm also starting to get a bit bored with
playing HiraBot, DCNN, and AyaBot. I'll likely start adding the
occasional fast automatch game (with high handicap allowance) to mix
things up. For slower even games I have AYD and
[Mostly Go](http://swannodette.github.io/baduk//2016/09/01/mostly-go.html),
for faster even games Foxy and WBaduk. I've also been firing up
GoQuest for some fast 9x9 which I find I quite enjoy now.

I've signed up for two New York area tournaments, one hosted by the
[New York Institute of Go](http://www.ny-go.org) and the other is the
annual
[Stonybrook Sakura Matsuri Go Tournament](https://www.facebook.com/events/235184340376716/).
The former I'm entering as 6 kyu and the later as 5 kyu. Hopefully I
can show better results over those 8 rounds and give my AGA
rating (7 kyu) a boost before the [US Go Congress](https://www.gocongress.org).
