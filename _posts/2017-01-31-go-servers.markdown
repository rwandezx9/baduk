The online Go community seems small only if you exclude yourself from
the *massive* community of Go players in China, Korea and
Japan. Recently, I've been spending more and more time on Tygem and Fox
and I've come to really enjoy it even as I find myself getting beat up
a lot.

What people say is true, there's many sandbaggers and you frequently
encounter some non-verbal rudeness when the game is clearly over. But
these issues don't really bother me anymore, and I find myself really,
really enjoying the fighting heavy play style. It certainly drives home
how weak my middle game really is. I'm learning to always check
whether an aggressive looking move is just an overplay. I'm developing
a sense of when to back down or step up to a fight. I'm finding games
often quickly leave the books where I'm left to my own devices and I
simply need to *try something* instead of burning time trying to
calculate (check it in review!). These are all weaknesses in my own
game so this is welcome game experience. Go is such a dynamic and
active game and it's refreshing for me to see that perspective on Fox
and Tygem.

The only problem is if you're not a Windows users. Until I started
playing Go, I really had no need for Windows outside of the occasional
work thing. I tried Wine on OS X to participate on Tygem and I found
it too buggy to be practical. I instead now use
[Virtual Box](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/VirtualBox) and the
[Windows 10 ISO](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10ISO). You
can easily find instructions online about setting up Windows 10 with
VirtualBox. Once you've got that up and running, installing the clients
is a breeze.
