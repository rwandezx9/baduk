I had trouble sleeping due to my excitement about the US Open. I ended
up waking up around 5am today and couldn't go back to sleep. To pass the
time I played multiples moves on my DGS correspondence games till
about 7am at which point we started getting ready to leave.

We arrived at the venue about 10 minutes before 9am. The pairings
were posted on the entrance to the main hall and I walked over to my
spot. As I was configuring the game clock my opponent walked up. She
was also registered as a 7 kyu like myself. Before the game we chatted
a bit about our background with Go. She hailed from Portland, Oregon
and had been playing for about 3 years. She seemed like a very
experienced player to me and we had a very enjoyable evenly matched
game.

The time settings were 1 hour 30 minutes for each player plus 5
periods of 30 second byo-yomi. Komi was 7.5. I'm a pretty slow player
so I completely ate through all of my time. The game lasted three
hours. In the end I won by a tiny margin - 2 1/2 points. At no moment
did I feel like there was a significant difference in our skills. So
perhaps the 7 kyu rating I assigned to myself is right on the money
over a real board.  At the end of the game I knew I had made a lot of
bad moves so I really looked forward to getting a professional
perspective on the game later that day. 

One side lesson I learned was that the main hall was quite cold and
that it's a pretty good idea to bring a sweater especially if your
game might go on for three hours.

We broke for lunch and returned around 1:30pm. Pro reviews, simuls and
lectures were all underway!

I briefly attended Kim Myungwan's Liberty Racing lecture but this was
primarily aimed at Go teachers so I quickly moved onto Stephanie Yin's
(1P) game reviews for beginning to 5 kyu players. I
really enjoyed Stephanie's review style and was hoping to get a review but
unfortunately I joined too late and she ran out time and needed to
go deliver a lecture at 3pm. I was a little disappointed but the
following reviewer for the same player levels was Feng Yun 9P and she
gave me an unforgettable commentary. There were sequences I struggled
over for many minutes that she saw literally in the blink of an
eye. As I predicted there were many, many mistakes - in many cases she
pointed out moves I had considered but had discarded for all of the
wrong reasons. The experience was both incredibly humbling and
thrilling and I was extremely grateful for her time.. The following
GoKibitz embed is my game along with her commentary as I remembered
it. I stayed on for several more commentaries as there was just tons to
learn from her reviews. After this experience, I fully plan on getting
my games reviewed each day.

After the review session I took a break from the conference to wrap up my
blog entry on the first day of the congress. By the time I returned
around 7:30pm the evening activities were in full swing. My Go friend
participated in the AGA ranked games while I merely observed as I was
pretty exhausted after an intensive day fueled by only 5 hours of
sleep.

After his rather fast paced game we took a quick peek at the 9x9
tournament. I spied [Nathan Eagle](https://twitter.com/neagle/) and I
took a moment to introduce myself. We ended up having a long delightful
chat about our experiences with Go over the years, his fantastic
[GoKibitz](http://gokibitz.com) project, and the new
[National Go Center planned for DC](http://nationalgocenter.org) (he's
helping out with the website). Turns out that Nathan is also good
friends with [BenGoZen](http://bengozen.com) who heavily inspired me
in writing this congress series in the first place.

At this point I was pretty exhausted so we called it a night. Tomorrow
I'll be participating in the US Open again and having won the first
game Nathan Eagle said tomorrow I will be facing a stronger opponent. I
also signed up for a simul with Lee Dahye Korean 4P and co-author of
[Falling In Love Baduk](http://senseis.xmp.net/?FallingInLoveWithBaduk). 

With these challenges ahead of me, I'm planning on getting a full
night's rest!
