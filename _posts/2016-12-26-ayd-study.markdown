I'm only a few days away from starting the 17th season of the American
Yunguseng Dojang. At this point, I'm unlikely to hit my stated
November goal of KGS 4 kyu by the end of the year, but that's OK by
me. In an effort to play more briskly as well as solidify what I
learned over the past three months, I've been playing many games on
IGS. I had an old provisional 10 kyu account I never used beyond
following Japanese pro events, so I decided to see how well I
would. After 20 games I now have a solid 8 kyu rank, which, as far as
I can tell, is quite comparable to KGS 5 kyu and the
[ratings comparison chart seems to confirm this](http://senseis.xmp.net/?RankWorldwideComparison). My
rated win/loss on IGS so far is 16-5, so I feel confident that my KGS
rank is close to the mark with respect to my current ability.

Looking at my KGS rank graph over season 16, I can say with even more
certainty that I think investing in AYD was the right idea for
improving my game. Still the cost isn't insignificant, and I think to
get the most out of In-seong's system you have to really take
advantage of the materials provided and be ready to put
some time in outside of the scheduled AYD events.

What follows is an idiosyncratic take on how to get the most out of
In-seong's online school.

# Online reviews

I wish I had done this earlier - you should try to play your AYD game
at the scheduled time. Getting feedback right after your game while
it's still fresh in your mind is important. Even if your game isn't
reviewed you should absolutely stay for the reviews of the
other games in your league band. While you may initially believe that
your mistakes are somehow unique or special, sitting through other
game reviews will quickly disabuse you of that notion. Within a league
band, you will see many, many similar mistakes whether opening theory,
patterns, direction of play, endgame, and of course life and
death. It's watching other game reviews that convinced me to revisit
my approach to life and death. I no longer feel that there are go
problems "below" my level.

# Lectures

In-seong's lectures rock. It's a solid mix of theory, philosophy, and
practical technique. However, at first I thought I should go out of my
way to make it to the lectures. Now that I have a season under my
belt, I can say that missing a lecture is not a big deal - not like
missing the live reviews. You can always watch these later if some
reason your life schedule makes it hard to attend.

None of this is to say the lectures are not a critical part of AYD, in
fact, quite the opposite. AYD is more like a school less like a
one-on-one teaching environment. Game reviews rarely go longer than 15
minutes, so In-seong will often identify a knowledge or technique gap
and point out a previous lecture you should watch to fill in those
gaps. You should take this advice seriously and queue up some time to
go over this content, likely, a couple of times.

# Books & Tsumego

You should probably continue whatever self-study schedule you had
before, just make sure it's guided by whatever you're picking up from
AYD. For me this has been about studying patterns, evaluating a
position, and doing tons of easy life and death. Currently I'm on
Essential Life and Death Volume 2 and working my way through the
1000+ Wbaduk advanced easy problems. The problems are slightly harder
than Graded Go Problems For beginners Volume 3. Speaking of which, I
went through that book for the 4th time over a few days. It's a good
set but I'm now convinced that the Jump Level Up! series is a superior
approach for understanding these kinds of life and death problems.

# Play lots of Games

You're not going to improve very quickly if you only play AYD
games. It's important to play faster games outside of AYD to
solidify what you've learned as well as stretch your ability.

I played 28 games this month, 2 on Tygem, 5 on KGS and 21 on IGS. A
few were complete disasters like my two blitz games on Tygem, but for
the most part my games were reasonable wins and losses. I currently
have a tentative plan to use Tygem for warmup blitz, KGS for medium
pace games, and IGS for more thoughtful games (Canadian time is just
better suited for it).

Well that's that. I'm looking forward to see how much I improve in season 17!
