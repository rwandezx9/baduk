Yesterday I participated in my third go tournament. The
[2017 Gotham Go Tournament](http://www.peterarmenia.com/GothamGoTournament.html)
took place at [Hosteling International NYC](http://hinewyork.org) at
103rd Street and Amsterdam. The venue was smallish so space was limited to
84 players. I actually found out about it quite late and was number 7
on the waiting list. Luck was on my side and I got an email last week
confirming my spot. The registration was a reasonable $30 dollars
considering you got free coffee, bagels, and a tournament t-shirt. The
tournament was 4 rounds, AGA rules, with time control of 35 minutes of
main time plus 5 periods of 20 second byo-yomi.

Registration started promptly at 9am and I arrived by train around
9:10am. The tournament was slated to start at 9:30am but due to some
issues with the 1 train, the tournament started quite a bit later. I
said hello to familiar faces from Mostly Go and I got interviewed by
someone from
[BadukTV](https://www.youtube.com/user/onbaduktv/videos). If I'm
luckly maybe I'll get a few seconds of screen time in December.

My first opponent was someone I knew from Mostly Go. The last time we
chatted he claimed he was a 7kyu. I myself had entered the tournament
as 6 kyu, a rank somewhere between my KGS rating of 5 kyu and my AGA
rating of 8 kyu (down from 7 kyu as I did badly at the Sakura Matsuri
Tournament at Stonybrook). Thus I took white. This game went pretty
smoothly for me. The game didn't involve too much excitement and I won by
about 20 points.

After the first round there was an hour break for lunch. I walked a
couple of blocks over to [Xi'an Famous Foods](http://xianfoods.com)
for a delicious helping of Spicy and Tingly Beef Stew. After a relaxed
lunch I went back for round two.

My second game was against a young kid rated at 5 kyu. Due to an early
game blunder I lost this game. I tried to recover but I couldn't close
the gap. I lost by komi.

The third round was the most interesting of the day. I played against
a fellow from the Stonybrook tournament who had entered as 5 kyu. We
were pretty evenly matched and I had a pretty nice sequence in this
game that turned the tide in my favor. However, I think I played it a
bit too safe after that and my opponent was able to chase and I
eventually lost the game by half a point. This game was a ton of fun
so the loss didn't really sting as much as the first one.

The final game was against another kid I played at Stonybrook but this
time I won. It wasn't particularly interesting. While the kid had good
fundamentals and I made a couple of mistakes, I just made more
territory in the end and he didn't try to counter my plans and take
control of the situation.

So I went 2-2 and I'm perfectly happy with that. Hopefully that can at
least correct the damage of Stonybrook.

There's not much other news to report of late. I'm sticking with my
regimen of playing fast handicap games against the dan level bots on
KGS as well as fast games on WBaduk and Foxy. I have a slight
preference for WBaduk as the players seem a bit stronger and less
picky about their opponents. I did crack open
[Naoki Miyamoto's](https://senseis.xmp.net/?NaokiMiyamoto)
[Breakthrough to Shodan](https://senseis.xmp.net/?TheBreakthroughToShodan). When
I picked it up many months ago I found it a bit too cryptic for my
taste but now that I'm playing more often a lot of the points in the
book are resonating with me.

I've also been revisiting John Fairbairn's
[Kamakura](https://senseis.xmp.net/?KamakuraTheBook). One thing I've
observed is that as you improve what strikes you in professional game
records changes quite a lot.
