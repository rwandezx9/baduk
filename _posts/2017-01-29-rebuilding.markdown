February is fast approaching. My Yunguseng record for January was just
OK, 2-3 so I'll be staying in League G. In most of the reviews
In-seong continues to emphasize that I need to play more quickly. My
opening intuition is fine and I should trust my instincts, but my slow
play means I'm not learning enough about all the opportunities present
in the middle game. Habits are hard to break, but I really am
trying. I got more than 50 games in this month across KGS, IGS, Tygem
and Fox.

After having lost many fast games on Tygem against supposedly weaker
players it's clear that my teacher's assessment is right on the
mark. I don't know how long it will take for me to really break
through but on the bright side I'm starting to have a lot more fun
playing Go.
