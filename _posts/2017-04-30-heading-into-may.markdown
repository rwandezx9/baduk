In terms of visible personal Baduk progress April hasn't had much to
offer. My record so far in AYD is 1-2, and I'm back to IGS 7 kyu after
losing most of my games this month. Yet I find that my stalled rank
doesn't necessarily correspond to my feeling of forward
momentum. Perhaps that's because this month I've been focusing on two
particularly important Go skills - mind control, and attitude. In
truth these two skills differ only in scope, the former is with
respect to individual games, and the later with respect to
overall results when actively striving to gain a stone.

# Mind Control

[The very first golden rule of Go](http://senseis.xmp.net/?TheTenGoldenRulesList)
is a psychological tip rather than a tactical one - Greed does not
give victory. For a game so rich with calculation, a significant
factor in a playing a good game lies in controlling your emotional
state. If you're constantly invading and fighting you are playing an
unreasonable game and bad results are well deserved. Why invade when
you can reduce? Why kill when you can win? When your opponent
finds a great reduction or tactical maneuver why become frustrated
when frustration will simply cloud your judgement? 

Occasionally I review a professional game record that contains exactly
the lesson I needed at that moment in time. This month it was Shusaku
vs. Sekyima, a articuarly aggressive opponent. In these records it became clear that
you cannot fight flowing water.

# Attitude

If you expand mind control to cover emotional state with respect to
improvement then you get to attitude. If you are greedy to improve
then you'll likely feel significant disappointment when you
don't. [Recently I read through the Life in 19x19 threads on rates of improvement](http://lifein19x19.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=13052&hilit=rate+progress)
and it was clear that for a great many people improving even one stone
required two or three hundred, or even five hundred games! If I'm
being honest with myself reaching 4 kyu KGS or 6 kyu IGS could easily
take 5 months of continuous effort at my current rate of 40-60 games a
month.

In the end Go isn't my job and I don't want it to be. I'm never going
to be a professional and while I aspire to be a dan level player one
day, that aspiration should never get in the way of having a good
time.

# Results

When I say I haven't seen much in the way of results in April, I'm
really talking about the upper bound of my play. Your rank is an
average of your best qualities and your worst qualities. So while I'm
having trouble improving at the top end, I find I'm doing a pretty
good job ditching old bad habits and pulling up the low end. For
example, I'm pretty much breezing through Foxy 6 kyu when hardly
two months ago I was really struggling against Foxy 8 and 9 kyus.

# Sakura Matsuri Festival Go Tournament

Next weekend I'll be attending the Sakura Matsuri Festival Go
Tournament at Stonybrook University in Long Island. Ien Cheng and
Logan Buckly will be joining me. It's 4 round tournament, so I'm
expecting pretty tight time controls (25 minutes, 3x30 seconds
byo-yomi). While of I hope my record can reflect my progress these
past six months, I'm mostly looking forward to a good time with Go
friends. I'll be recording my games of course and I'll post about
them here.

# Smart Go Guess Move Feature

Smart Go is the Go app that keeps on giving. These days I use
primarily to review my games, check joseki and fuseki variations, and
browse through occasional professional record - mostly Go Seigen or
Cho Hun-hyeon.

I finally got around to using the Guess Move feature and I must
say that I really like it. It's a great way to test your ability
to see the big picture.
