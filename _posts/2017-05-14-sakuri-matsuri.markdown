I attended my second Go tournament ever on May 7th. The [Stony Brook Go
Club](https://stonybrook.collegiatelink.net/organization/goclub) has
been running a tournament during the university's [Sakuri Matsuri
(Cherry Blossom Festival)](http://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/japan/programs/sakura.html)
since 2011. I first heard about it through the [AGA](http://www.usgo.org/news/2012/05/quaid-tseng-6d-tops-stony-brook-sakura-matsuri-go-tourney/)
a few years ago but my involvement in the game wasn't yet strong
enough to get me out there.

My Go friends Ien Cheng and Logan Buckley were also interested in
attending which provided extra motivation. So we found ourselves early
Sunday morning piling into my car in Brooklyn to make the first round
by 10am. The drive was a little over an hour and the scenery of Long
Island along the way was the pleasant green of springtime.

The festival and Go tournament took place in the Charles B. Wang
Center. The tournament itself was on the lower level, but the modern
design of the building was such that the tournament area received
quite a bit of natural light. Bagels and coffee were served while we
waited for players to arrive and pairings to be calculated. I had
entered as a 6 kyu, Ien Cheng as 10 kyu, and Logan as 10 kyu.

The tournament was a 4 round tournament so the time controls were
surprisingly tight and I wasn't quite prepared for that. Instead of
byo-yomi, the timing controls were Fischer 25 minutes plus 5 seconds
per move. In at least my first game, I overestimated how much
Fischer time will add to your clock.

The first round started around 10:30am. This match was going OK
for me and I believe I could have won, but I ran into time trouble and
lost on time. I made the mistake of trying to record the game with
SmartGo and that ate considerably into my clock. As far as I could
tell the proper pace should have been about 20 seconds per
move.

As it turned out Ien and Logan got paired in the first round! Though Ien
won, it seemed like a pretty good game for both. 

After the first round, a free lunch of
sandwhiches and sushi was served and we went over our games. After
lunch we went upstairs to fuel up on coffee and we noticed the center
was filling up with festival attendees. There were a number of people
in traditional Japanese attire as well as a few cosplayers. The
location of the tournament was actually quite clever, many festival
goers would walk up and inquire about the nature of the game.

My second opponent was a young 6 kyu, a student of
[Feng Yun](http://www.fengyungoschool.com). I made a lot bad mistakes
in this game and my opponent won with very little
effort. Somewhere in the middle game I started focusing on points and
was able to chase, but not nearly enough to close the gap in a
meaningful way.

My third opponent was a regular member of the Stony Brook Go
Club. This game wasn't really going my way but I initiated a ko and my
opponent made some mistakes in choosing his threats. After I won the
ko, the game was effectively over but my opponent lost on time so we
didn't get to counting.

The final round was also going my way but I made a critical mistake by
missing a connection and my opponent started a splitting attack that
was just working. I didn't have enough time on my clock to come up
with anything clever so I lost on time.

So in the end my result was 1-3. I don't expect my AGA rank to get
much of a boost, but that's fine by me. As I noted in my last post my
attitude about the game is quite different these days. As entertaining
as online go can be, nothing beats playing over a real board and
putting a real face to your opponent. Nearly all my games started and
ended with a meaningful bit of conversation about our mutual interest
in Go and that alone makes these games both more memorable and
enjoyable than my typical IGS or Foxy games.

Funny enough, Ien and Logan also came out with 1-3 results. For Ien
that's actually a big deal since his last AGA rank from US Go Congress
was 14 kyu. In Logan's case it was his first tournament. As far as I
could tell, we all had a great time. Along with the games it was also
a great chance to hang out with a lot of familiar faces from the New
York Mostly Go community.

I have little doubt that I'll be attending next year if nothing else
gets in the way.
