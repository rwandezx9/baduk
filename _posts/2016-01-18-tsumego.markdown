These days I find myself spending considerably less time with Baduk
theory books and considerably more time with tsumego, commented games,
and of course playing games and reviewing. Studying commented games is
a relatively new activity for me and if hadn't been for Baduktopia's
Jump Level Up series I may put it off indefinitely. Perhaps I missed
the obvious, but it was never clear to me how one should go about
incorporating the study of higher level games. The Jump Level Up!
series shed considerable light on the matter.

## Jump Level Up! Volumes 1-5

Jump Level Up! is a great series originally written in Korean and then
translated into English. Though targeted at young players, the
workbooks are suitable for any single digit kyu. Unlike the Graded Go
Problems series (GGPB), Jump Level Up! (JLU) is primarily focused on
drilling fundamental tactics. Nearly all of the problems can be solved
in a few seconds - but that's the point. Most pages have 6 simple
problems and it rarely takes more than 10 minutes to get through
three pages.

The series would be worth it for the drilling alone, but the books also
emphasize two other important areas of study - joseki and
openings. The joseki presented are all simple. You are asked to play
through them three times while considering the meaning of each
move. Unsurprisingly after the third time you've got it down. This
repetition study is reinforced by subsequent problems that explore
simple variations, mistakes, and their appropriate punishments. I've
always found joseki incredibly dry, but the highly structured and
gradual approach taken by the book has made me come to appreciate
joseki and I know find myself enthusiastically studying joseki
variations that occur in my own games.

Each book in the series also includes several openings from
professional games - usually the the first 50 to 80 moves. Again JLU
asks you play through them three times carefully considering the
meaning behind each move. Initially I discovered it took me 4 or 5
times before I could play them back from memory, but now I can usually
get them in the suggested iterations. I was personally stunned that it
took so little effort to memorize an opening and for fun I tried an
experiment with a Go book that's been on my shelf for years -
Invincible: The Games of Shusaku.
