I recently picked up the Jump Level Up! (JLU) series published by
Baduktopia. This series for fills a much needed gap in the Go pedagogy
I've encountered thus far. The series is tailored for young children but
this also means the series is perfectly well suited for adults as
well.

Unlike the Graded Go Problems for Beginners (GGPB) volumes, many of
the puzzles presented show positions likely to be encountered in
actual play. While GGPB tends to develop your overall visualization
skills, JLU gives you tools for making the right decision quickly
while the clock is ticking.

For example capturing races ofter occur in real games.

Yet again we have the fast and slow principle. JLU gives you problems
you should be answer in seconds - that is they should be
instinctual. GGPB guides you towards deepening your reading
skills. Some problems are just not possible to be sure of without
reading out several variations.

When attacking GGPB problems quite I find myself making the wrong
play. Often the particular incorrect line of play will not be
elaborated. At this point I stop and see if I can find the opponent's
counter move that somehow missed.

Sometimes I still cannot find the best counterplay. At this point I
copy the problem as SGF and paste it into Smart Go Kifu. There I try
out the variations until I can find the opponent's best play. At that
point I dig in until I see how the opponent's best play foils success.

Then return to the original problem and verify that I can see the
failing line of play without actually playing out any moves.
