In this point I'd like to talk a bit more about [Graded Go Problems for
Beginners Volume 4] (GGPB4) as well as a new series (for me), [Jump Level Up!
Volumes 1-5]. I spoke about the former in my previous post and I'd
like to dive into my approach to studying it which other people might
find useful.

The later came to my attention because the series comes from the Baduk
degree program at Myongi University of South Korea. The entire series
is designed expressly for children. Presented in workbook style, it
features comis, cute drawings, and funny stories. However it's my firm
belief that presentation styles designed for younger audiences is more
or less precisely the same style you should be using with adults.

The series is also a good antidote (for me anyway) in my struggles
with GGPB4.

Unlike the Graded Go Problems for Beginners (GGPB) volumes, many of
the puzzles presented show positions likely to be encountered in
actual play. While GGPB tends to develop your overall visualization
skills, JLU gives you tools for making the right decision quickly
while the clock is ticking.

For example capturing races ofter occur in real games.

Yet again we have the fast and slow principle. JLU gives you problems
you should be answer in seconds - that is they should be
instinctual. GGPB guides you towards deepening your reading
skills. Some problems are just not possible to be sure of without
reading out several variations.

When attacking GGPB problems quite I find myself making the wrong
play. Often the particular incorrect line of play will not be
elaborated. At this point I stop and see if I can find the opponent's
counter move that somehow missed.

Sometimes I still cannot find the best counterplay. At this point I
copy the problem as SGF and paste it into Smart Go Kifu. By touching
and holding down on the stone next to the problem diagram you will get
a popup menu that offers a "Copy" feature. You can then switch to
SmartGo Kifu into the "My Games" tab and click the add game button -
you'll be offered the option to "Paste SGF".

There I try
out the variations until I can find the opponent's best play. At that
point I dig in until I see how the opponent's best play foils success.

Then return to the original problem and verify that I can see the
failing line of play without actually playing out any moves.

The other thing I love babout JLU is the method by which the book
covers joseki, understanding professional games, and.

As a general rule the problems are very easy. As a KGS 8-9kyu I find
that I can answer the problems instantly. But that's really not the
point. All of the ideas presently are precisely the kind of thing that
should come instantly to your during actual play. You *should* be able
to do these in your sleep.
