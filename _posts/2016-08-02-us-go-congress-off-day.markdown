# Off Day

Today was the off day. After three rounds of the US Open and three
rounds of the US Open ahead of me, I thought it perhaps wise to have a
rest day and skip the die hard tournament. I slept in and got off to a
much needed late start. I met Ien and his friend Tony for lunch at a
terrific Shanghainese restaurant close to MIT. Afterwards Ien and I
went sighting seeing in and around the MIT campus. Our first stop off
was the MIT Museum.

I really wanted to visit the MIT Museum to take a look at the old MIT
Lisp Machine they have there. Lisp was a programming language created
by John McCarthy in 1957 (pictured on the left) to pursue artificial
intelligence, a term he actually coined. There's no question that the AlphaGo
dream would not have been possible without the important work of AI
pioneers like McCarthy. Of course the approaches used by AlphaGo are
quite different, but the benchmark of computers besting humans at
deep strategic games is nearly as old as the field of computing itself.

The other reason I was so interested in getting a look at this machine
is that I write software with Lisp, a new-ish dialect called
Clojure. In our modern technology driven world, anything older than two
years is considered obsolete, so Lisp at nearly 60 years seems
particularly antiquated. However I've spent the past week playing a
game with as much enthuasiam and excitement as people did some 4000
years ago, so perhaps that's another reason why I'm so attracted to
Go - it really puts the passing of time into perspective.

After the MIT Museum Ien gave me tour of the MIT campus. We walked
through many of the famous buildings and libraries including the Stata
Center and the MIT Media Lab. At one point we stopped off in the
famous lecture hall 10-250. Here's a shot of Ien writing "Lisp Lives!"
on a blackboard.

After the MIT tour we jumped on the metro to the Boston Convention
Center where we met an architect friend of Ien's who is now based in
Boston. Ien and Eric had known each other from a previous collaboration. Eric showed
us a very cool project called Swing Time which from what I was told is
pretty popular in Boston now. It was quite beautiful and I
snapped a picture before I tried them out myself.

After that we had a cocktail at a nearby spot and we then took
an Uber back to the Evening League.

# Evening League

I spied Nathan Eagle working through some cool designs for the
National Go Center website. I have no doubt it's totally gonna rock
when it's released for all the world to see. We chatted for a bit
about his US Open game and we started walking through a review. Kevin
Hwang came by to say hello and he also hadn't seen GoKibitz
before. During the review Nathan pointed out some features of GoKibitz
that I didn't even know existed!

It was starting to get late but somehow Kevin still convinced me to
do a Go Talk interview. It was a lot of fun and I hope I didn't look
or sound too tired.

Ien and I then retired to rest up for Round 4.
