I'm discovering there are some strong correlations between how I study
guitar and how I now study Baduk.

## Scales: Jump Level Up! Volumes 1-5

The very first thing I do when I pick up the guitar is warmup with
some scales. It seems to me it is no different for Baduk, you warmup
with some easy problems.

[Jump Level Up!](http://senseis.xmp.net/?JumpLevelUp) is a great
series originally written in Korean and then translated into
English. While targeted at younger players, the workbooks are suitable
for anyone stronger than 15kyu. Unlike the
[Graded Go Problems series (GGPB)](http://senseis.xmp.net/?GradedGoProblemsForBeginners),
Jump Level Up! (JLU) is all about *drilling*
fundamentals. Nearly all of the problems can be solved in a few
seconds - but that's the point. Most pages have 6 simple problems and
it rarely takes more than 10 minutes to get through three pages.

Like scales JLU covers ground that should be instinctual. How can you
play even the most trivial piece of music if you can't place your
fingers consistently and confidently?

I strongly suspect I'll be reading them over and over again on the
path to shodan.

## Short Studies: Baduk Classic

After your scales you continue to warm up with something more
substantial. On guitar I've been slowly working through the
[Complete Sor Studies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methode_pour_la_Guitare).
There are many shorter pieces that present a challenge without
requiring a huge investment of time.

Having worked through GGPB I was on the lookout for a more challenging
problem set. Baduk Classic to the rescue!
[Lee Hajin's review of the Baduk Classic edition of Guanzipu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxl3Jwqj1I)
sold me on the entire series. All together the Baduk Classic series
comprises some thousand problems ranging from 3kyu to higher dan in
difficulty. Each problem is clearly marked making it simple to skip
over the ones not yet within my grasp.

The problems are stunning and really nothing like anything I've
encountered so far in kyu level tsumego texts, they do not have simple
answers and often have interesting variations which are never
discussed. Harder problems have dramatically changed my relationship
to reading. It's is not only about finding the right answer, but
finding all the wrong ones, and the ones that lead to the best outcome
for the opponent.

In my own games I'm now beginning to see that knowing what *not to
play* is probably as important if not more so than finding that
rare gem of a brilliant tesuji.

## Longer Studies: Invincible

Mixed in with simpler pieces, Sor includes studies that are
unquestionably interesting music. These invite deeper study,
memorization, and expressive play.

While it's been sitting around on my bookshelf for some time, it
wasn't until JLU that I really felt inspired to dive into
[Invincible: The Games of Shusaku](http://senseis.xmp.net/?Invincible). Each
JLU book includes the opening from 5 pro games. You are encouraged to
play each opening three times. I was surprised to find that after an
extra fourth time I could commit an opening to memory.

Out of curiosity I challenged myself to memorize the Shusaku vs. Shuwa
(1842) game record. This two stone handicap game where Shusaku
demonstrates his budding powers lasts only 148 moves so this seemed
like a reasonable place to start. After about a week or so I could
confidently play the game from beginning to end without referring to
the record. More importantly by memorizing the game and trying to
understand the moves on my own, the commentary became alive where
previously it had simply fallen on deaf ears.

It's true that the openings in Invincible are a bit old fashioned but
to be honest I don't think it matters much. The power on display is
palpable and working thoroughly and slowly through the records and
commentary have completely changed how I think about the game.

Interestingly I've found that few people describe how they study
Shusaku and in a future post I'll dig a deeper into my approach as
a single digit kyu.

## Performance: Play & Review

Eventually you have to put all this knowledge to the test. As a musician
this means playing in front of an audience or getting just the right
take for a recording. Playing a piece of music in the cozy
comfort of your room is nothing like the pressure cooker of a live
stage or a recording schedule. It's no different for Baduk. Book
smarts that you cannot access during a live game is wasted effort. For
this reason alone I drifted away from theory books and focused on the
process I've outlined above.

I don't play a ton of games, just enough so I'm moving forward. I'm
probably getting about 8-11 games in a month - once a week at the NYC
Mostly Go Meetup, 3-6 games on KGS and I have about 4 running games on
DGS. Given that, game reviews become even more important.

As a musician reviewing means listening to your performance - either
something from the board or in the studio when tracking. The
loop between performance and listening is a truly powerful one. It's
not all about picking on mistakes, sometimes a whim or accidental
pause leads to a phrasing you could have never imagined
otherwise and these ideas feedback into your technique.

Again it's the same for Baduk. After a game I find that I usually
spend *more time* on the review than I did during the game. Along with
the blunders and mistakes are the solid moves, the right directions,
and those incredible surprises that keep us all coming back to Baduk.

## Results

Is this approach paying off? Two years ago I was a KGS 9kyu. Currently
I'm on a 6 game winning streak and just shy of KGS 6kyu. This approach
might not be the right way for everyone, but I think it's interesting that
applying a similar discipline from my guitar studies to Baduk has
kicked off a period of steady measurable improvement. Perhaps this
approach can work for others?

See you on the board!
