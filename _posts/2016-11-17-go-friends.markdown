It turns out that Nate Eagle (of [GoKibitz](http://gokibitz.com)), Ien
Cheng, Logan Buckley and myself share quite a few interests: Go,
literature, poetry, and a mean cocktail. A couple months ago Nate and I
decided it would be great to have him drive up from Washington, DC for
a weekend of Go. His visit would be the perfect excuse to round up
some friends and make the trek out to Flushing to visit
[Stephanie Yin's (1P)](http://senseis.xmp.net/?YinMingming) school,
the [New York Institute of Go](http://www.ny-go.org). We decided that
the first weekend of November would be good time for all.

Nate arrived at my Brooklyn apartment late Friday afternoon, November
4th. I, of course, pulled out my Kuroki Goishiten set. We started an
even game which didn't go so great for me. To be fair, Nate's knocking
on the door of 1 dan AGA, so this was to be expected. When playing
against much stronger players, it's always illuminating to see many of
your assumptions put to question. We had to pause to head off for
dinner; Ien had picked a really nice classy spot in Manhattan and we
ended up having a long, laid back meal and talked about pretty much
every topic imaginable.

The following morning over green tea, we wrapped up our game from the
day before and Nate won by killing a weak group thanks to sharp
reading and good utilization of thickness. It was the second proper
game I'd played on my board which I use mostly for self-study.

By the time we finished it was time to head off to Flushing. Logan
stopped by and we all jumped on the 7 train. The trip took about an
hour and a half from door to door and we walked into Stephanie's school
around 2pm. Saturdays were clearly a slower day as we were the only
people there.

There were four tables and two decent table boards each. There
was also the typical big lecture board you saw at the US Go Congress.
One wall was covered with pictures of Stephanie with
legendary Go players: Nei Weiping, Lee Chang-ho, Masaki
Takemiya, Cho Hun-hyun, and more. We settled in and the person running
the school that day was incredibly nice and made us tea.

Logan and Nate paired off while we waited for other
people to arrive.

By 3pm Ethan Cahn, Harry Teitelman, and Ien Cheng had all made it. Ien
and Ethan paired off for a game, and I started a 2 stone game with
Harry. I won my game and I decided to try my hand at another round
against Nate. This game was also on its way to a quick finish due to
my overplay. We didn't have time to see it through though as I wanted
to get everyone over to Han Joo, one of the best Korean BBQ spots in
Flushing.

It was about a 30 minute walk to the restuarant and everyone enjoyed the
food and drink as much as I hoped. After a long dinner suffused with
good natured and emphatic discussion we all went our separate ways.

The following day Nate and I played one more game which I lost yet
again due to misjudging my opponent's position, so the game ended pretty
early on in fairly complicated (for me) capturing race. We reviewed
the game for a good bit, and Nate was kind enough to point out the
mistakes from much earlier in the game that led down the undesirable
path.

After the game we went and met one of his old friends at a popular
Williamsburg diner. They had brought their kids along and it ended up
being a really fun and energetic breakfast. Nate needed to head back
after that so the Go weekend finally came to end.

Now that I'm a much more avid player I suspect these Go weekends will
become something of a regular thing. On the horizon we have the
Maryland Open and the New Jersey Open and I'll do my best to get this
great group of folks together again for these tournaments.
