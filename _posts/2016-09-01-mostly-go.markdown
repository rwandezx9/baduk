You live in New York City. You like Go. What should you do?

Head on over to Pie By The Pound every Wednesday between 6pm and
10pm!

Shortly after the AlphaGo matches against Fan Hui, I decided I really
needed to check out the Manhattan Go scene. After a surprising amount
of stumbling about I finally came across the
[Mostly Go Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/mostlygo/). The meetup was a
kind of umbrella for three distinct weekly events. One of these was up
by Columbia University (The Hungarian Pastry Shop), another at a game
parlor popular with NYU students (the event was somewhat
inconveniently scheduled for Sunday afternoons), and another,
centrally located just a few blocks away from Union Square. None of
these events had much in the way of typical "I'm going"
confirmations, so from the online impression at least these events looked
abandoned. Still who knew? If I recall correctly, I pulled Ien, Zane, and several
other friends along to scope out the central event out for
the first time this past February.

The central meetup is hosted at Pie By The Pound, a nice little spot that
sells pretty tasty pizza that has a fairly large back area with a
significant number of board games stacked on a bench. This game stack
includes several Go boards of varying degrees of quality. We walked up
around 7pm and we were stunned to see all boards occupied with a solid
15 people in attendance. In fact it became pretty clear that in order
to really guarantee a game it's probably best to bring whatever travel
set you own (I have the Bento set from GoGameGuru).

We nervously introduced ourselves and found the attendees to be
incredibly friendly. The strength range was comfortingly broad - from
AGA 7 dan to absolute beginners looking to learn the game. Because of
the Go handicap system it's not hard to find an opponent and play an
interesting game. I've given four stones to 14 kyus and lost and taken
six stones from 7 dans and lost. Point is, your skill level should not
be a deterrent, you can absolutely play a game and have a fantastic
time. Plus if you record your game several of the regular stronger
players are more than happy to give friendly reviews.

Unsurprisingly, many of the attendees are quite active in the broader
American Go scene. Not only did we see many familiar faces at the US
Go Congress, many of those faces turned out to be people who have been
pretty heavily involved in promoting Go for some time.

All this to say, if you're a Go enthusiast and you're not attend
Mostly Go, you are seriously missing out. Come and bring your
portable Go set. 

See you across the board!
