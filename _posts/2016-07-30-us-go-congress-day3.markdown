# Round 2

I slept a little better due to my complete exhaustion from the day
before. Around 8:30am I made the now habitual short trek to the
congress venue propelled by iced coffee. I sat down across from my
opponent about two minutes after 9pm. As with the previous round, I
created the kifu with my iPhone via
[SmartGo](https://www.smartgo.com). Today's opponent was another 7 kyu
but this time I played white. While the 7.5 komi is certainly adequate
compensation from a quantitative point of view, you still have to
deal with the psychological advantage that black gets by dictating the
opening of the game.

My opponent played the
[Sanrensei](http://senseis.xmp.net/?SanrenseiFuseki).

With a slight sinking feeling I knew I had a very long fighting game
ahead of me. Indeed, I once again ran down my clock to the last
byo-yomi period. While I didn't check, I'm pretty sure my opponent was
doing great on his time as he played his moves pretty quickly. This
game record isn't complete because I just didn't have time to tend the
record as the game was clearly extremely close and I had to make all
my end game moves in under 30 seconds. I also didn't have time to
count during the last 20 minutes or so of the game so when we got to
counting I knew it was going to be a couple of points either way. With
some apprehension I watched my opponent count my area and then I
counted his. I ended up winning by 3.5.

While I was happy with the win, I admit I felt pretty unsettled during
the entire game because I don't have much experience with the
Sanrensei at all. I also felt my opponent was a bit more aggressive
then yesterday's opponent and I had to wrack my brain for ways to
prevent them from controlling the game direction from beginning to
end. I also spent a very long period of time working through many
different possibilities for reductions which seemed critical for
keeping things balanced. I hope the choices I made were reasonable but I
won't know for sure until the review which will have to wait until
tomorrow since I opted to play a simul against Lee Dahye at 1pm. I
plan to get insights from Feng Yun or Yang Yilun tomorrow afternoon
about this game as well as the third round so you will see that
commentary in this embedded record in the near future.

# Pro Simul

I grabbed a tasty Chinese lunch across the street from the congress
with my Go buddy (Ien Cheng) and a new friend Ethan from the NYC Mostly
Go Meetup. While scarfing down double cooked pork we all talked about
our love for the game and our various approaches to
self-improvement. As we were finishing Stephanie Yin (1P) came
in and we chatted briefly about her new Go school in Flushing, New
York! Ien and I plan to check it out at the soonest opportunity.

At this point it was getting close to 1pm so I walked quickly back to
the main hall where the tables were prepped for the pro simuls. There's a
first time for everything, and this was my first time to play a simul
game with a Korean Baduk professional. I prepared the board with the
recommended 6 stone handicap for my declared rank. During simul games
the professional moves briskly from board to board spending only a
couple of seconds before playing their move. When they arrive at your
board you should have your response prepared and play it
immediately. This means the pace of the game is pretty fast even with
six people playing the same pro. But it also makes the game a whole
lot of fun! And even though Lee Dayhe played six congress attendees at the
same time, after each win (she didn't lose to anyone) she would spend
5 minutes reviewing critical moments of the game with perfect recall -
this was really astounding to behold.  I've embedded her commentary
along with record.

Unbeknownst to me Anders Kierulf was behind me observing the
game. After the Lee Dahye review he introduced himself and complimented my
play. It was our first time to meet in person and we had a very nice
friendly conversation about the awesomeness that is US Go Congress
(he's a veteran) as well as SmartGo Kifu and SmartGo Books, two
fantastic bits of Go software I can now no longer imagine living
without. Thanks to Nathan Eagle for clandestinely snapping this photo!

# Kim Myungwan Lecture

After our chat I swung by Kim Myungwan's lecture titled Puppydogs &
Bulldozers. This was a really fantastic talk that applies to pretty
much any game whether you've just learned or you're an amateur 6
dan. Kim categorized Puppydog play as mindlessly responding to your
opponent without taking the time to assess the whole board. The
Bulldozer play is when you keep pursuing a line of play which
obviously won't work. As Lee Sedol says, Go is full of "twists and
turns" and it's probably best not to drive off the side of the
mountain. Kim's lecture drove this principle home and I intend to keep
this mind in the remaining four round of the US Open.
