I'm lucky enough to travel a bit for work. Usually when I'm in a new
or interesting city I often do a bit of research to figure out the
local live music scene and attend a show if I can. More and more these
days I also find myself checking to see if there's a local Go club
event. 

Work happens to take me to Durham, North Carolina at least twice a
year and I recalled there being a pretty active Go scene there thanks
to mentions by the
[American Go Association](http://www.usgo.org). Turns out the
[Triangle Go Club](http://http://www.trianglegoclub.org) has been
running for 40 years!

They have a couple events a week, and luckily for me, including one on
Wednesday nights at [Social](http://socialdurham.com) in downtown
Durham. They also have one on Fridays at a Starbucks better situated
between Durham, Raleigh, and Chapel Hill. However, being sans car and
having other plans on Friday, I decided to take the short walk from my
hotel and arrived a little before 8pm.

When I walked in there were two games in progress. I asked if I could
sit down and watch a game. It turned out to be a match between an AGA
6 kyu also visiting from out of town (and a regular member of the
Seattle Go Club) and Frank Salantrie AGA 3
dan. *[Frank Salantrie is the one who built the board gifted to China by Barack Obama!](http://www.trianglegoclub.org/theboard.htm)*

Another person, Bhaskar, walked in with a board and I asked them if
they wanted to play. We found a spot at the bar and my opponent unfolded
a nice, inexpensive portable board. He was an 18 kyu who
had just picked up the game in earnest a month and a half ago thanks
to the excitement of the AlphaGo matches. I asked about the board and
he said he picked it up in Austin, Texas at
[Great Hall Games](http://greathallgames.com). That's also where I had
bought my first board and my first go books more than a decade ago!

We played a teaching game and I hope my opponent enjoyed it. While we
played I took a look around, there were a couple of new games going on
at this point. The vibe reminded me a bit of
[Mostly Go](http://swannodette.github.io/baduk/2016/09/01/mostly-go.html) -
relaxed, and you can definitely get two games in if you make it by 7pm
when the event starts.

After my game I chatted a bit with one of the Triangle Go organizers,
Bob Bacon. Turns out they just held one of their biannual tournaments
on September 25th with 39 players ranging from 30 kyu to 5 dan! Any Go
enthusiast in the Triangle should feel lucky to have such an active
club. 

It was starting to get late so I said my farewells and wandered
off to look for a bite to eat. I definitely plan on attending the event
again next time I'm in town.
