# Patterns, patterns, patterns

Once again my lack of familiarity with basic patterns came up again in
the review of round three. The first pattern mistake involved my
deployment of the Chinese opening. The second pattern mistake was my
approach move to an already enclosed star point. Since my method of
acquiring Baduk knowledge (outside of life & death) has been always been
something of a random walk, it's unsurprising that I have an
incredible number of holes. American Yunguseng
Dojang is giving me something long and sorely lacking in my Baduk
studies - a real sense of *direction*.

For example, even though I know how to place the first three stones to
form the Chinese, I hadn't dug deeper into the variations. The simple
truth is, left to my own devices, I never felt particularly inspired
to memorize openings. But now that I have a teacher wagging a finger at
my blunders, I am considerably more compelled to be a studious Baduk
player. So following In-seong's recommendation I watched his lecture
on the Chinese opening. His explanations always emphasize the most
practical and straighforward lines of play over complicated and less
typical variations. I was able to apply my new knowledge in round four
this evening.

Also my intuition about Cho Hun-hyeon's book with respect to
In-seong's emphasis on gathering practical knowledge about basic
patterns turned out to be right on. I'm constantly reading about
something In-seong mentioned in a lecture or review and vice versa. So
reinforcement learning for the win!

# Round 4

I was able to pull through with a half point win the fourth round
thanks to an overlooked cut by my opponent. White had the advantage
for most of the game due to several mistakes I made as pointed out by
In-seong. I had seen most of the big/urgent moves he suggested but
my intuition for when they should be played needs further
development.

The big mistakes for me in this round was approaching the top left on
the narrower side (for my potential shape) and then not producing a
sensible shape. My timing for enclosing the upper right corner was way
off. Finally, my iron pillar in the lower left was pointed out as
notably of DDK quality by In-seong. I should have just kicked. I
suspect I'll never make that mistake ever again.

Happily, In-seong did say the game was *stable*! I suspect Season 16
is going to be pretty much entirely focused on pursuing stability and
studiously filling the gaps in my practical game knowledge. Often you
hear people say that once you get to single digit kyu, one of the most
certain ways to gain a stone is to just chip away at your
mistakes. Well ... I'm chipping away!

If I win my final round for September on Tuesday I think I have a shot
at getting promoted to league G. It's composed of folks around 5-6 kyu
so that'll be some solid pressure on my capability. If I don't make
it, it's also no big deal - all of my league H games have been fun and
challenging and I clearly have *plenty* to learn.
