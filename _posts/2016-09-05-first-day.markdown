Today marks the start of the 16th season of American Yunguseng
Dojang (AYD). It feels like the first day of school! So far I've been very
impressed with how smoothly AYD is run. All the rounds have been
scheduled and we received the emails of every member in our respective
leagues so that we can reschedule as of course life often demands. I'm
in fact playing my first round tomorrow at 6pm instead of Thursday
because I'm traveling for work.

The first lecture is this evening at 9pm, but I accidentally watched
the same lecture given to the European Yunguseng Dojang this afternoon
as I happened to be logged into KGS. As expected, the lecture was
great. In-seong Hwang's style is to focus on only a very few concepts
each lecture and drill the idea home with many, many examples from
professional games, his own games, and Yunguseng games. His laser
focus on fundamentals reminds me a lot of what I enjoyed about the pro
reviews at the US Go Congress. I look forward to In-seong's reviews of
round one on Thursday with great anticipation.

Perhaps precisely because I've joined AYD, I've started playing a lot
more often on KGS. Unfortunately I've been on a bit of a losing streak.
It happens to everyone and I don't feel particularly discouraged by it
or anything like that, in fact quite the opposite. When reviewing the
losses it's surprsing how many of the critical errors made are
incredibly simple reading problems - nothing complicated. Live games
can really cloud your judgement and I just don't play enough of
them. I'm also probably at the 7 kyu hump and my book-ish approach to Go is
finally catching up with me. Which isn't to say I'm going to stop
hitting the books, it's just that now it's clear there's an imbalance.

So for me the month of September is going to be one of focusing on the
fundamentals and playing many more live games - at least a couple of
KGS medium speed games a week in addition to my AYD League games and
my games at Mostly Go when I can fit it in. If I get to the other side
of September with a less foggy head while playing my live matches and
fewer obvious mistakes (at my level anyway) then I'll be quite pleased.
