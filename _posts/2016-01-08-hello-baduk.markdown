I have recently been spending more of my free time playing and
studying the ancient Chinese board game
[W&eacute;iq&iacute;](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)). In the
West, W&eacute;iq&iacute; is more commonly known by its Japanese name,
Go. My enthusiasm for this incredible game has finally grown enough to
start a dedicated blog about it.

I first encountered Baduk (as it is called in Korea) as a child at my
grandmother's house in Uijeongbu. However, I did not learn the
beautifully simple rules until years later, and initially, I was just
intrigued by the lack of strong computer Go technology; the strongest
computer Go programs of the early 2000's floundered in the beginner
ranks. I found this particularly puzzling since it only takes about
fifteen minutes or so to learn the rules. Curiosity drove me to a
local Austin, Texas game shop where I picked up a couple of books on
Go and an inexpensive set.

In rather short order, I found it difficult to further advance my
understanding of the game. Learning by yourself without a support
network is a long, grueling process. Go, like Chess and other great
games, is fundamentally social phenomena; you need players, teachers,
clubs, tournaments and so forth.

Unfortunately, unlike Chess in the United States, Go has never had a
figure in the popular consciousness to bolster its troops. The
fear-mongering, real and imagined, around the Cold War veritably
sealed the hero status to be endowed upon Bobby Fischer after
[his victory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Chess_Championship_1972)
over Boris Spassky. Overnight, a curious intellectual pastime became a
nationalistic act.

Over the years the popularity of chess has waned and it's once again
viewed as a somewhat obscure activity. Still, the shift of the 1970s
can be felt, finding a strong chess enthusiast to learn from or
joining a local chess club in the States does not stretch the
imagination.

The on-ramping story for Go is significantly less inviting. The
problem in many ways boils down to language barriers. The vast
majority of contemporary Go literature, and thus pedagogy, is only
available in Chinese, Japanese and Korean. Many of the good books
available in English are Japanese translations from the 70s, 80s, and
90s and while unquestionably classics, they suffer from an old
fashioned approach to teaching Go.

I believe a couple factors are swinging things in the right direction
for a whole new level of popularity for Go in the States - the wide
availability of inexpensive mobile touch-enabled technology, and the
embrace of the Internet by the growing English friendly Go community.

In this post I hope to draw a map for the would-be Go enthusiast. Go
information is unevenly distributed across the World Wide Web and
requires a surprising amount of dedicated stumbling about. I hope to
save the next adventurer some time; the following links and
suggestions are meant to quickly introduce a newcomer to the wonderful
world of Go and give a reasonable path to consistent improvement at
the game without an undue expenditure of effort.

## Mobile Technology

Who would have thought a 3000 year old-game would be so well
suited for our touch-enabled mobile computing present? There's quite a
few Go applications for mobile devices but the SmartGo series is a
complete game changer for anyone armed with an iOS device that wants
to pick up Go at a reasonable clip.

A couple of years ago I purchased
[SmartGo Player](https://www.smartgo.com/player.html) for a couple of
bucks. I was so impressed by the experience that I quickly upgraded to
[SmartGo Kifu](https://www.smartgo.com/kifu.html). This is a one stop
shop for playing against the computer, practicing problems (2000+), studying
professional Go games (80,000+), and reviewing and annotating your own
games. It works perfectly with the
[SGF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_Game_Format) format
(unsurprising, as the app author, Anders Kierulf, invented the SGF
format in the late 1980s). Whether you save your games via DropBox,
encounter games via web browser links, or copy games from SmartGo
Books (more on this later), you can easily open up a SGF file and try
variations and make annotations on lines of play.

Prior to SmartGo, digging into a game or problem required breaking out
the goban (Go board) and working through the variations. Eventually this will
become good practice but it requires far more memory dexterity than
can be expected from beginners trying to build an interest in the
game. I can't say enough good things about SmartGo. Just get it.

## Internet

While playing and studying by yourself is an important part of your
growth as a Go player, it's tough to stay enthuasiastic when you don't
feel like you're a part of a larger community. For a time it even
seemed the English speaking online Go community was waning - many once
popular English Go blogs are now inactive or unavailable. But in
reality, I believe the community just shifted towards more modern
forms of community building better suited to drawing people into the
game - specifically, high quality video commentary.

Game commentary is a deeply important activity in the Go world, but
prior to the last few years you either had to read a book or
understand enough Chinese, Korean, or Japanese to watch a Go
television show.

So what's the best place to watch free English friendly Go commentary
videos you ask?

*YouTube!*

### YouTube

My current favorite of all the Go commentary channels on YouTube is
Lee Hajin's (Korean 3p)
[Haylee's World of Go/Baduk](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTji1kQNoWIH85dB_Vxka9g). Lee
Hajin, who is also the Secretary General of the
[International Go Federation](http://www.intergofed.org), plays
relatively fast paced games on Tygem or the Kiseido Go Server while
speaking in a highly engaging way about her thought process. Her
channel cannot be over-recommended:

allowfullscreen></iframe>

Nick Sibicky records his Go lectures and like Lee Hajin's channel is a
treasure trove of Go commentary. His delivery style on classic games
is filled with drama and history:

<iframe style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 2px; margin: 1em 0;" width="736" height="420" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ME0SQK_5BNY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

[Go Game Guru](http://gogameguru.com) has become an essential source
of Go news for an English speaking audience. An Younggil (Korean 8p)
gives deep, deep commentary on a variety of games. His style is highly
analytical, and to be honest his lectures often move so quickly as to be
completely over my head, but that just makes me that much more excited
to deepen my understanding of the game!

### Internet Go Servers

Eventually you'll want to try to play some games. Unless there's a
very active Go club in your neighborhood, an online Go server will be
the easiest way to put theory into practice.

There are several Internet Go servers to choose from and I'll only talk about the
ones I am active on. Notably missing here are Tygem and the Online-Go
Server. My impression is that they are both fantastic places to play
and in particular the Online-Go Server may be better suited for people
just starting out who want to play a friendly game. Tygem has many
Korean players which usually means you may have a harder time getting
your bearings as the community is considerably stronger on average.

I only have extensive experience with the Dragon Go Server and the Kiseido
Go Server so I will focus on these for now.

### Dragon Go Server

[Dragon Go Server](http://senseis.xmp.net/?DGS) (DGS) is a simple turn
based server with clients for both Android and iOS. For your first
games you may want to try a couple of 9x9s (the full game is 19x19)
with a stranger or a friend who is also interested in the game.

Turn based Go means you get to spend a lot of time on each move. It's
a great way to work on your reading skills without working up your
blood pressure due to a ticking clock.

However being able to think quickly on your feet is another valuable Go
skill to develop so you should also spend adequate time playing
faster paced games on a server with a strong post-game review culture.

Enter KGS.

### Kiseido Go Server

The [Kiseido Go Server](http://senseis.xmp.net/?KGS) (KGS)
requires using a very clunky-looking Java application that is actually
surprisingly stable, featureful and intuitive to use.

When you are just starting out with the Go, one of the hardest things to come by
is a game where you're actively learning something. The biggest
issue with low double-digit kyu games (25k-15k) is that you have two people
pitted against each other neither whom have a good feel for the
mechanics of the game yet.

For this reason it's important to reach out to stronger players and
request a teaching game. You'll find yourself improving at a much more
rapid rate and soon enough you'll be able to return the favor by
showing the next low double-digit kyu (DDK) the ropes.

The strong teaching and review culture of KGS is absolutely the best
thing going for it. KGS also regularly broadcasts Go tournaments from
around the world and lots of players gather around to banter and
occasionally predict the next move.

Suffice to say, KGS is a whole lot of fun. Properly navigated it will
kick start your love of the game in no time.

## Learning

Just watching videos and playing online won't alone be enough to improve your
understanding of the game. Eventually you'll want to spend some time
with a book to give some definite shape to what at this point are only
vague intuitions.

Thankfully learning to play Go has never ever been as straightforward
as it is today. I've found [SmartGo's Go Books](https://gobooks.com)
to be another indispensible and convienient tool on the path to
achieving further insights about the nature of Go.

Many classic titles are available for Go Books - having a treasure
trove like
[Invincible: The Games of Shusaku](http://www.amazon.com/Invincible-Games-Shusaku-Game-Collections/dp/4906574017)
literally in the palm of your hand is really something else.

### Books

There are a few good modern books for beginners in
English these days but the following I can vouch for without
hesitation having read them several times.

[Learn To Play Go by Janice Kim & Soo-hyun Jeong Volumes 1-5](http://senseis.xmp.net/?LearnToPlayGoSeries). These
books are a great way to get a feel for the big ideas of the game
delivered in an intuitive style. They don't work completely by
themselves since there aren't enough problems, so you should
supplement these books with
[Graded Go Problems for Beginners Volumes 1-4](http://senseis.xmp.net/?GradedGoProblemsForBeginners).

These 9 books can be easily consumed in a few months but they could
just as well keep you busy for a year if combined with active
play. With the exception of the first volumes of each series,
these books warrant repeat reading.

If you somehow devour all of this, you'll be ready to switch to
meatier material. I strongly recommend a book that I only recently
picked up,
[Yilun Yang's The Fundamental Princples of Go](http://senseis.xmp.net/?FundamentalPrinciplesOfGo). Until
I read this book I frankly found most other books on opening theory as
well joseki (standard opening patterns) fairly bewildering. This is a
very hard book, but like the other books it gives more with each
read. The book while thorough, also gives you an easy to recall set of
principles that you can bring to each game you play.

I've also enjoyed
[Lessons in the Fundamentals of Go](http://senseis.xmp.net/?LessonsInTheFundamentalsOfGo)
as well as all the books in the
[Elementary Go Series](http://senseis.xmp.net/?ElementaryGoSeries). The
problems presented in the later series are significantly more
challenging than the Graded Go series but if you've gotten this far I
think you'll find that you'll absorb far more than you won't.

### Tsumego & Game Review

Learning Go feels much more like learning a new language than learning a
game. If you want to pick up a new language you have to practice a
little bit each day. Probably more than anything else Go is about
*reading*, that is, the ability to visualize lines of play without actually
placing stones on the board.

You'll probably find Graded Go Problems for Beginners Volumes 1 & 2
relatively simple to get through. Even for absolute beginners the
problems rarely take longer than a minute to solve. Starting with Volume 3
things become significantly more challenging. Often the obvious move
does not actually work and you should take a moment to find your
opponent's best counter play. Contrary to what some people suggest, I
don't believe it's a issue to look at the answer if you cannot solve a
problem in a reasonable amount of time. Often problems which you find
difficult involve some fundamental insight you either haven't
encountered before or haven't fully driven home. When you return to do
the problem again in a later reading you'll have forgotten the answer
but will be armed with the new knowledge needed to reach the solution
this time around.

Graded Go Problems for Beginners Volume 4 is very challenging. You may
find yourself starting this one several times and being quite
bewildered. Stick with it. By the time you feel these problem are within
reach you'll be stunned how much you can visualize in your head.

Again expect to read these books several times.

The other important piece of advice is to take the time to review your
games, wins *and* losses.

### Playing Slow, Playing Fast

In
[The Natural Way to Draw](http://www.amazon.com/The-Natural-Way-Draw-Working/dp/0395530075),
Nicolaides emphasizes the importance of drawing both very slowly (3
hour studies) and very quickly (3 second studies). It's no different
with Go. It's just as important to play very slow games where you have
ample time to consider your options as it to play against the clock
where the speed and accuracy of your reading ability is put to the
test.

Divide your time between turn based servers where you have ample time
and timed games. I started out favoring 30 minutes of main time and 5
byo-yomi periods of 30 seconds for my KGS games. After watching Lee
Hajin's videos I've now switched to 10 minutes of main time with 3
byo-yomi periods of 30 seconds. This time control setting means the
game lasts 40-50 minutes at most - a reasonable amount when you have
a lot of other things to attend to in your life.

### Playing Lots of Games

Some people play many, many games back to back in rapid
succession. Doing this to recover from a losses for fear of losing a
rank or two is especially missing the big picture. Win or lose, a game
isn't any good if you don't take time to review it. It's highly likely
that your winning games have just as many bad moves and blunders as
your losing games.

I play a couple of games a week on KGS and I have 3-4 games going at a
time on DGS. I find that this is enough to keep me busy and if I'm
hitting the books and watching commentary, my game keeps on improving
anyhow.

## Caveats & Conclusions

This post is of course my very idiosyncratic take on how to go about
learning and enjoying the game of Go. Everybody has different tastes
and inclinations so what works for me might not work for you at all. Still,
I hope this first post gets you excited about diving into the world of
Go. If you stick with it I guarantee you'll discover a game that will
keep you intrigued for a lifetime!
