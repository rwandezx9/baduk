I have recently been spending more of my free time playing and
studying the ancient Chinese board game
[W&eacute;iq&iacute;](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)). In the
West, W&eacute;iq&iacute; is more commonly known by its Japanese name,
Go. My enthusiasm for this incredible game has finally grown enough to
start a dedicated blog about it.

I first encountered Baduk (as it is called in Korea) as a child at my
grandmother's house in Uijeongbui. However, I did not learn the
beautifully simple rules until years later, and initially, I was just
intrigued by the lack of strong computer Go technology; the strongest
computer Go programs of the early 2000's floundered in
the beginner ranks. Curiosity drove me to a local Austin, Texas
game shop where I picked up a couple of books on Go and an inexpensive
set.

In rather short order, I found it difficult to further advance my
understanding of the game. Learning by yourself without a support
network is a long, grueling process. Go, like Chess and other great
games, is fundamentally social phenomena; you need players, teachers,
clubs, tournaments and so forth.

Unfortunately, unlike Chess in the United States, Go has never had a
figure in the popular consciousness to bolster its troops. The
fear-mongering, real and imagined, around the Cold War veritably
sealed the hero status to be endowed upon Bobby Fischer after
[his victory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Chess_Championship_1972)
over Boris Spassky. Overnight, a curious intellectual pastime became a
nationalistic act.

Over the years the popularity of chess has waned and it's once again
viewed as a somewhat obscure activity. Still, the shift of the 1970s
can be felt, finding a strong chess enthusiast to learn from or
joining a local chess club in the States does not stretch the
imagination.

The on-ramping story for Go is significantly less inviting. The
problem in many ways boils down to language barriers. The vast
majority of contemporary Go literature, and thus pedagogy, is only
available in Chinese, Japanese and Korean. Most of the good books
available in English are from the 70s, and while unquestionably
classics, they suffer from an old fashioned approach to teaching
Go.

I believe a couple factors are swinging things in the right direction
for a whole new level of popularity for Go in the States - the wide
availability of inexpensive mobile touch-enabled technology, and the
embrace of the Internet by the growing English friendly Go community.

In this post I hope to draw a map for the would-be Go enthusiast. Go
information is unevenly distributed across the World Wide Web. Over
the years I stumbled about considerably and I hope to save the next
adventurer some time. The following links and suggestions are meant to
quickly introduce a newcomer to the wonderful world of Go and give a
reasonable path to consistent improvement at the game without an undue
expenditure of effort.

## Mobile Technology

Who would have thought a 3000 year old-game ago would be so well
suited for our touch-enabled mobile computing present? There's quite a
few Go applications for mobile devices but the SmartGo series is a
complete game changer for anyone armed with an iOS device that wants
to pick up Go at a reasonable clip.

A couple of years ago I purchased
[SmartGo Player](https://www.smartgo.com/player.html) for a couple of
bucks. I was so impressed by the experience that I quickly upgraded to
[SmartGo Kifu](https://www.smartgo.com/kifu.html). This is a one stop
shop for playing against the computer, practicing problems (2000+), studying
professional Go games (80,000+), and reviewing and annotating your own
games. It works perfectly with the
[SGF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_Game_Format) format
(unsurprising, as the app author, Anders Kierulf, invented the SGF
format in the late 1980s). Whether you save your games via DropBox,
encounter games via web browser links, or copy games from SmartGo
Books (more on this later), you can easily open up a SGF file and try
variations and make annotations on lines of play.

Prior to SmartGo, digging into a game or problem required breaking out
the goban and working through the variations. Eventually this will
become good practice but it requires far more memory dexterity than
can be expected from beginners trying to build an interest in the
game. I can't say enough good things about SmartGo. Just get it.

## Internet

While playing and studying by yourself is an important part of your
growth as a Go player, it's tough to stay enthuasiastic when you don't
feel like you're a part of a larger community. For a time it even
seemed the English speaking online Go community was waning - many once
popular English Go blogs are now inactive or unavailable. But in
reality, I believe the community just shifted towards more modern
forms of community building better suited to drawing people into the
game - specifically, high quality video commentary.

Game commentary is deeply important activity in the Go world, but
prior to the last few years you would either have to read a book or
understand Chinese, Korean, or Japanese well enough to watch a Go
television show.

The best place to watch free Go commentary videos you ask?

Youtube.

### Youtube

My current favorite of all the Go commentary channels on Youtube is
Lee Hajin's (Korean 3p)
[Haylee's World of Go/Baduk](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTji1kQNoWIH85dB_Vxka9g). Lee
Hajin, who is also the Secretary General of the
[International Go Federation](http://www.intergofed.org), plays
relatively fast paced games while speaking in a highly engaging way
about her thought process. Cannot be over-recommended:

allowfullscreen></iframe>

Nick Sibicky records his Go lectures and like Lee Hajin's channel is a
treasure trove of Go commentary. His delivery style on classic games
is filled with drama and history:

[Go Game Guru](http://gogameguru.com) has become an essential source
of Go news for a English speaking audience. An Younggil (Korean 3p)
gives deep, deep commentary on a variety of games. His style is highly
analytical, and to be honest his lectures often move so quickly as to be
completely over my head, but that just makes me that more excited
to deepen my understanding of the game!

### Internet Go Servers

There a quite a few Internet Go Servers and I'll only talk about the
ones I am active on. Notably missing here are Tygem and the Online Go
Server. My impression is that they are both fantastic places to play
and in particular the Online Go Server may be better suited for people
just starting out who want to play a friendly game.

### Dragon Go Server

Dragon Go Server is a simple turn based server with simple clients for
both Android and iOS. For your first games you may might want to try a
couple of 9x9s.

### Kiseido Go Server

One thing to watch out for when you're just starting out in the
beginning ranks is unkind players who are also trying to assess their
interest in the game. I think one way to avoid this is try servers
which are more welcoming for beginners.

This above all is what has kept me playing on KGS despite it's
extremely antiquated Java based client. There are a variety of rooms
and the Teaching Ladder is a good place to try and pair up with a
stronger player to get a better feel for the game.

### Translated Videos

## Learning

Learning to play Go has never been so straightforward. Thanks to
tablets and the popularity of Internet Go, the amount of support for
picking up the game is incredible.

## Books

My first Go book was [Kaoru Iwamoto's Go for
Beginners](http://senseis.xmp.net/?GoForBeginners). While
comprehensive, the book is incredibly terse and a bit old-fashioned in
terms of its delivery. There are a few good modern books for beginners in
English these days but the following I can vouch for without
hesitation:

[Learn To Play Go by Janice Kim & Soo-hyun Jeong Volumes 1-5](http://senseis.xmp.net/?LearnToPlayGoSeries). These
books are a great way to get a feel for the big ideas of the game
delivered in an intuitive style. They don't work completely by
themselves since there aren't enough problems. So you should
supplement these books with
[Graded Go Problems for Beginners Volumes 1-4](http://senseis.xmp.net/?GradedGoProblemsForBeginners).

These 9 books can be easily consumed in a couple of months but they
could easily keep you busy for year if combined with active play. With
the exception of the first volumes of each series they warrant
multiple reads.

If you somehow devour all of this, you'll be ready to switch to
meatier material. I strongly recommend a book that I only recently
picked up
[Yilun Yang's The Fundamental Princple's of Go](http://senseis.xmp.net/?FundamentalPrinciplesOfGo). Until
I read this book I frankly found most other books on opening theory
as well joseki fairly bewildering. This is a very hard book, but
like the other books it gives more with each reach. The book is
comprehensive but it also gives you an easy to remember series of
principles to bring into every game you play.

I've enjoyed [Lessons in the Fundamentals of Go]() as well as all the books in the
[Elementary Go Series](http://senseis.xmp.net/?ElementaryGoSeries). The
problems presented in these series are significantly more challenging
than the graded go series but if you've gotten this far I think you'll
find that you'll absorb far more than you won't.

## Studying

Do go problems everyday. You'll likely find Graded Go Problems for
Beginners Volumes 1 & 2 relatively simple to get through. Starting
with Volume 3 things become significantly more challenging. Often the
obvious move does not actually work and you should take a moment to
find your opponent's best counter play. The first time through the
book my reading ability wasn't good enough to read out the lines of
play. I had significant difficulty keeping positions in my
head. Counter to what many people suggest, I would just use Smart Go
to play the sequence picking the best move each time. You'll pick up
important concepts.

Volume 4 is very challenging. You may find yourself starting this one
several times and being quite bewildered. Stick with it. Eventually
you'll be able to make it through Volume 3 quickly while still doing
thorough readings.

Expect to read these books again and again.

Actually review your games.

Get a copy of Invicible: The Games of Shusaku.

## Playing Slow, Playing Fast

In The Natural Way to Draw, Nicolaides emphasizes the importance of
drawing both very slowly (3 hour studies) and very quickly (3 second
studies). It's no different with Go. It's just as important to play
very slow games where you have ample time to consider your options as
it to play against the clock where the speed and accuracy of your
reading ability is put to the test.

While I still don't enjoy blitz games.

Time limits. When starting out there is a tendency to use long time
limits even though you have very limited reading skills. Think of the
game as the performance of the music you been rehearsing for a while.

### Playing Lots of Games

Some people play many, many games back to back in rapid
succession. Doing this to recover from a losses for fear of losing a
rank or two is especially missing the big picture. Win or lose, a game
isn't any good if you don't take time to review it. It's highly likely
that your winning games have just as many bad moves and blunders as
your losing games.

I play a couple of games a week on KGS and I have 3-4 games going at a
time on DGS. If find that this is enough to keep me busy and if I'm
studying my game keep on improving anyhow.
