On Saturday I'll be jumping on a train bound to Boston to attend the
[US Go Congress](http://www.gocongress.org). It'll be my very first
time so I'm excited about every single aspect of the
conference: the US Open, pro lectures, reviews, simuls, and making
lots of new friends who share a common love for this ancient game.

Besides the AlphaGo keynote on Saturday I'm probably most excited
about being in the presence of all the folks who make the English
speaking Go community great. I've read
[Yilun Yang's books](http://senseis.xmp.net/?FundamentalPrinciplesOfGo),
listened to [Guo Juan's KGS lectures](http://senseis.xmp.net/?GuoJuan), used [Anders
Kierulf's software](http://smartgo.com), watched [Kim Myungwan's live commentary of AlphaGo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMqjGNqfU6I),
enjoyed
[Kevin Hwang's GoTalk interviews](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCq9Fa2sPq2oI5jkECRZNoBw),
commiserated with [Brady's
Blunders](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCf18LbpYx0bOUSzINhpL17Q),
learned from [Nick Sibicky's lectures](https://www.youtube.com/user/nicksibicky), and been in awe of [Lee
Hajin's Korean pro skills](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTji1kQNoWIH85dB_Vxka9g). They will all be in attendence!

To capture just a tiny fraction of this awesomeness I'll be keeping a
daily diary of my time at the US Go Congress. While I'll probably be
too busy during the conference to update my blog, upon my return, I
plan to write a post for each day. I'll share my US Open game records
(gulp) via [GoKibitz's](http://gokibitz.com) nice embedding feature,
include interesting photos, provide conference event experience
reports, and include whatever interesting anecdotes may arise. Why do
this?  Simply because I've really appreciated Baduk bloggers who took
the time to document their own experiences at past congresses like
[BenGoZen](http://bengozen.com) as well as various members of
[LifeIn19x19](http://lifein19x19.com). Their detailed descriptions
have certainly fueled my enthusiasm for attending this year. Hopefully
I can return the favor by inspiring someone else to attend their first
US Go Congress the next time around.

While I try to contain my excitement, I'll be spending a lot of
time this week trying to hit the books in preparation for the US
Open. I'm currently working through the following list and using
[my brand new Go set](http://swannodette.github.io/baduk//baduk,/equipment/2016/07/23/kuroki-goishi.html)
as much as possible before I depart.
