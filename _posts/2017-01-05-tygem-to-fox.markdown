The understandably thrilling excitement around
[Master(P) (now revealed to be the successor to AlphaGo)](https://twitter.com/demishassabis/status/816660463282954240)
inspired me to fire up VirtualBox on my Mac laptop and install the
[Fox Go Server](http://weiqi.qq.com) client so I could observe some of
the games. As noted by others, the Fox client is a rebranded Tygem
client, so if you're familiar with Tygem you'll feel at home with the
Fox interface. I can also see how the rebranding bits are appealing to
a younger audience. Clearly something is working, at the peak of
Master-mania there were ***more than 30,000*** users logged in.

Even now, without Master, there seems to be many active players around
the clock, so getting a game request seems easier than Tygem. After
two fast paced games as a 9 kyu, my impression is similar to that of
Tygem - the skill level at 9 kyu is widely varying and the play style
leans toward the aggressive end of the spectrum. Like Tygem most of
the players won't know English so don't expect much in the way of
conversation. However, conversation isn't something I've ever really
looked for when playing Go online and the existence of
[GoKibitz](http://gokibitz.com) addresses the issue of friendly
post-game review when I feel like that's necessary.

So far the experience has been positive, so I think I'll probably
switch my fast paced game regimen over to Fox from Tygem. I continue
to feel good about this approach to addressing my strategic
weaknesses. Outreading opponents in local scuffles doesn't help me if
my strategic sensibilities haven't advanced much beyond 9 kyu. These
fast games handicap my reading ability and force me to stay focused on
the big picture.

Speaking of which, last night I won my first Season 17 AYD game. Even
in slower games I'm avoiding disadvantaged fights and paying more
attention to the territorial balance.
