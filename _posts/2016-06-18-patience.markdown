One of the best features of [KGS](http://www.gokgs.com) is
[KGS Plus](http://www.gokgs.com/kgsPlus.jsp). I nearly always listen
in on
[Guo Juan's as well as Yilun Yang's lectures each month](http://www.gokgs.com/plusSchedule.jsp). One
thing that really struck me in one of Yilun Yang's lectures was how much
he emphasized the importance of *patience*. Lately I've been
[improving a bit](http://swannodette.github.io/baduk//baduk,/study/2016/06/10/baduk-music)
and winning a good number of my games. I was surprised how many of
these games I was able to win when I was unquestionably behind. If I
were to attribute these wins to anything it would be patience.

By patience I don't mean timid play. By patience I just mean not
playing compulsively - to play only solid moves and to simply wait for
real opportunities instead of trying to force them from nothing. Time
and time again in my games I find that my opponent will play one slack
move giving me a clear window to pounce and gain a significant
advantage. And in so many of my losing games time and time again I see
my own compulsive desires to be clever or create a complication that
inevitably leads to a loss because the outcome was never clear to
begin with.

Yilun Yang often refers to this kind of play as "gambling".

One thing that's really, really driven home the value of patience is
handicap games. Handicap games against lower ranked players used to
give me anxiety but now I view them as a kind of treat. Every handicap
game is a delightful lesson in how to win a lost game. While it might
seem that handicap games would require trick moves and overplays, all
you need is a taste for light play and a healthy portion of
patience. The rank difference means the opponent will surely play
some inefficient moves and you absolutely cannot let these slide. 

But this is exactly the kind of attention to detail you need in even
games too!

Next time in your game when you're a bit behind and are considering
starting complications, instead patiently wait it out and keep an eye
out for that slack move then pounce!
