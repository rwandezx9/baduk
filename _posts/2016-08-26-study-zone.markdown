title:  "My Go Study Area"

In New York City space is at a premium so dedicating an entire area of
our apartment to my Go set is just impractical. Still I wanted to have
a pleasing if temporary space to study as well as play the occasional
game with a Go friend.

So the first thing I decided I needed was something to put the goban
on as the floor of the apartment is uneven enough that the board would
move when placing a stone with confidence. I decided that a folding
tatami mat would support the board quite nicely. It arrived a couple
of weeks ago and it did indeed fit the criteria. As to be expected,
the goban was much more stable when placed on the mat and looks quite
lovely to boot. The mat was also just the right size for two people to
play a game.

Never having been around tatami mats before, one aspect I never
considered was the smell! In fact when the mat first arrived it was
distractingly pungent, but over the past couple of weeks the scent has
diminished to a pleasant aura. Every morning I work through a Shusaku
game from Invincible and I've come to associate these meditations with
the smell of kaya mixed with tatami. It's great.

Sitting cross-legged in front of the goban for extended periods of
time is not particularly comfortable so I also picked up a pair of zabuton
cushions that match the color of the tatami mat. They arrived a couple
of days ago and they make studying considerably more pleasant. They
also slightly raise the body from the floor so you get a nicer view of
the game.

All these elements pack up quite nicely and quickly as you can see in
the image to the right.

Last night I invited Ien Cheng and Richard Harrington over to see
my set and the setup. We started a fairly fast paced game and it was
exciting to have the board put to its proper use. The board, the
stones, the mat, and a good Go friend all make for an incredibly thrilling
experience that's hard to capture with words alone. For the space of
an hour the sounds of shell and slate clicking on kaya filled the
apartment punctuated only with the occasional comment about Ien's
direction of play.

Ien's been playing actively for about 8 months now and his pace of
improvement continues to impress me. With a bit more focused studying
on reading Ien is well on his way to becoming a formidable opponent!
