title:  "My Go Study Area"

In New York City space is at a premium so dedicating an entire area of
our apartment to my Go set is just impractical. Still I wanted to have
a pleasing if temporary space to study games as well as play the
occasional game with a Go friend.

So the first thing I decided I needed was something to put the Goban
on as the floor of the apartment is uneven enough that the board would
move when placing a stone with confidence. I decided that a folding
tatami mat would support the board quite nicely. It arrived a couple
of weeks ago and it did indeed fit the criteria. As to be expected,
the goban was much more stable when placed on the mat and looks quite
lovely to boot. The mat was just the right size for two people to play
a game. 

One aspect I never considered about the tatami mat, never having been
around them, was the smell! When the mat first arrived it smelled
quite pungent, but over the past couple of weeks it has diminished but
not so much that you don't notice it while playing. Every morning I
work through a Shusaku game from Invincible and I've come to
associate these morning meditations with the smell of kaya and
tatami.
