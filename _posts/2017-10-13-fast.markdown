Recently I've been experimenting with playing extremely fast
games against 1D bots on KGS. Since these games are high handicap
games against bots I find that I feel relaxed and detached. As they
only last 5 to 15 minutes, I can play many, many games in a
short period of time.

In my even games against humans, even with faster time controls as
suggested by In-seong (10 minutes main, 3x30 seconds byo-yomi), they
can still take up to forty minutes. Fewer games means it's harder for
insights to stick.

When I first started this experiment, I was losing nearly all of my
games. After about 60 losses over two weeks and dropping back to KGS 6
kyu, it's been somewhat of a blow to my ego. But it was also
necessary. I finally started seeing the error of my ways (at least
at five stones) and I've started winning my games again. I find these
games train my intuition for defending weaknesses, attacking
weaknesses, and keeping tabs on the territorial balance.

Very fast games against bots certainly isn't going to become my main
approach to the game, but it feels essential to treating Go more like
riding a bicycle and less like a theoretical exercise.

The experience has also opened me up again to the idea of playing high
handicap games against weaker opponents. Since I'd joined AYD I'd
stopped doing that as all of the AYD materials are about even
games. Given my weak middle game, this seems like it would be quite
useful bring this back into my practice.
