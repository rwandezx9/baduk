title:  "Yunguseng Dojang, Round One Review"

I'm writing this post from an airport in Finland. As it turns out
In-seong didn't cover my game in the G,H,I League group review on
Thursday but he made an additional video of the two games he wasn't
able to get to. This is the fantastic thing about In-seong's school,
life gets in the way but all the reviews get recorded and you can go
back and watch the reviews when you have time. I've watched my review
three times already and I now feel very, very lucky that I made it
into American Yunguseng Dojang. I'm pretty certain that I'll be
sticking with it for at least a year.

In-seong's reviews really embody what I loved about the US Go Congress
professional reviews. Like Feng Yun, he is very direct - when you make
a mistake he simply calls it out without sugar coating. It's the
combination of slow games and critical reviews that enable you to
avoid making the same mistakes over and over again. In-seong often
checks how long you took to make a move and he consistently calls out
mistakes where the response was made in under ten seconds and better
alternatives were not considered. While I made many, many errors of
judgment, I'm happy that he didn't get the opportunity to criticize
how little time I spent on a move.

As I suspected In-seong agreed that other than the weak lower left
black formation, black had far better prospects in the game due to the
upper framework. My opponent clearly had more Go experience and
consistently demonstrated better instincts about direction of play
as well as responses to typical situations.

In the lower left I had an opportunity to split black by defending at
the 3-3. I've read about this many times in Yilun Yang's Fundamental
Principles of Go. But it's one thing to read about a concept
in a Go book and another thing entirely to actually apply it in your
games. Having a teacher point out the missed opportunity is a pretty
good way to incentivize looking for it next time. Another mistake was my
splitting move on the right side. It would have been better as a knight's
approach to exploit the weakness of the two fourth line stones. On the
way to Helsinki I was re-reading Yilun Yang's chapter on reductions
and invasions and I now knew the correct answer to a similar
situation because of In-seong's review. I was hoping that AYD might
round out my approach to studying Go but I didn't expect to have
pretty convincing evidence within the very first week!

Tonight is the next lecture and my next AYD game will be on
Wednesday. I'll continue to post about my AYD experience when it seems
appropriate but I can say with conviction that it's worth the
cost. In-seong's thoughtful and individualized teaching style combined
with the scheduling flexibility of an online school makes the whole
thing feel like an incredible deal not an expense.
