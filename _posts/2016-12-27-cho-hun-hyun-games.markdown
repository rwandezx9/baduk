title:  "The Best Commented Game Collection You Haven't Heard Of"

While the utility of studying master games for weaker players is often
hotly debated among amateurs, I'm firmly in the the camp that believes
doing so cannot hurt your game. For all the profound reading present
in a professional game record, they also contain a multitude of moves
well within the grasp of anyone dedicated to the game. In the
engrossing Baduk novel [First Kyu]() (which I'll talk about in more
detail in another post) Nak, a failed insei, tells Wook, a talented
player with professional aspirations, that theory and tsumego books
are for light entertainment, and the game records of masters are the real
subject worth of study. While I'm but a lowly single digit kyu, I
think there's a grain of truth here.

Unfortunately, as I've mentioned elsewhere, the pickings are somewhat
slim when it comes to game record collections with commentaries
in English. Fortunately what is available tends to be of
very high quality. If you've been playing Go since around AlphaGo
there's a fair chance you have
[Relentless](http://senseis.xmp.net/?Relentless) in your library. If
you've been playing Go for more than a year you might have heard
mention of
[Invincible: The Games of Shusaku](http://senseis.xmp.net/?Invincible)
in venerated tones. If you avidly follow contemporary Go,
[Lee Sedol's Commented Games](http://senseis.xmp.net/?CommentedGamesByLeeSedol)
may grace your collection. If you're a sucker for history like myself
there's little doubt a couple of John Fairbairn's collected
commentaries on Go Seigen's jubangos reside upon your shelves.

But in all the commented game recommendations I have encountered online I
never once heard
[Cho Hun-hyun: Life and Master Games](http://senseis.xmp.net/?ChoHunhyunLifeAndMasterGames)
mentioned. A quick search on [Life in 19x19](http://lifein19x19.com)
brought up exactly one post about the book with no replies. The book
was originally published in Japan in 1995 with the title **So Kungen
Igo Meikyoku-Shu** as part of
a series covering contemporary masters from outside of Japan. Now that I
have this book in my possession, it feels like I've found a real
treasure and I'd like to describe it detail. While it's out of print
it shouldn't be too hard to get your hands on a used copy if you like
what you hear.

The book consists of twenty of commented games. The first twelve are
from Cho's time as a newly minted professional of the Nihon Ki-in. The
later eight are from Cho's brilliant international career. Cho's
crowning achievement was defeating Nei Weiping in the very first Ing
Cup. The Ing Cup is often to referred to as the "Olympics" of Go due
to it's occurrence only once every four years. Cho returned to Korea
from the Ing Cup a national hero. This was after Cho had held *all*
Korean titles three separate years (1982, 1985, 1986). In fact, if not
for the meteoric rise of his student, Yi Chang'ho (nee Lee Chang-ho),
one can easily believe that Cho would have continued to accrue
titles in Korea and internationally for another decade.

In addition to the game commentary the book ends with some excellent
material describing the history as well as the then contemporary state
of Go in Korea (1990s). In the span of 50 years, top Korean players
went from needing to take two stones from visiting Japanese
professionals (also mentioned in First Kyu) to pretty much dominating
the international tournament circuit for two decades. For me, this book
is a critical missing puzzle piece in understanding how today's Go
came to be.

Identified as a prodigy at young age, Cho was sent from Korea to Japan
to study with the best. In then end, Cho was watched over by Segoe
Kensaku. Yes, the same Sego Kensaku that took in a young Chinese
prodigy some forty years earlier - Go Seigen.
