To help speed up the pace of my play I've started playing on the
[Pandanet Go Server](http://pandanet-igs.com/communities/pandanet) (IGS). Funny
enough that was the very first online Go server I ever played on
more than fourteen years ago with the
[Mac OS X Goban](http://www.sente.ch/software/goban3/)
application. The IGS ranking system requires you play at least 20
rated games to get a solid rank and after that the system is point
based. Since it doesn't factor in time like KGS, your rank is less
prone to wild fluctuations if you don't play that frequently.

I have to say it's a nice change. The Pandanet client looks nice, and
the server features a simple automatch feature same as KGS. I
currently have a provisional rank of 10 kyu which means I've been
playing against opponents in the 10-11 kyu range. Based on my first
three rated games, I would say that IGS 10 kyu is significantly
stronger than KGS 10 kyu. I've also played these games with Canadian
time and that's another welcome change. Getting a bunch more time back
after playing your 25th move sure takes the heat off during the middle
and endgame.

Already my openings are becoming less sluggish and I'm happy about that.

Besides that, I've started following two Twitch Go streamers, one
pretty well known, [hanayeol](https://www.twitch.tv/hanayeol) (6-7 dan
Korean amateur) and the other one less well known,
[jellyplaysgo](https://www.twitch.tv/jellyplaysgo) (KGS 4-5 kyu). I
also ordered a Go book I'd never heard of before,
[Cho Hunhyun Life and Master Games](http://senseis.xmp.net/?ChoHunhyunLifeAndMasterGames).
I'll definitely report on that when it arrives!
