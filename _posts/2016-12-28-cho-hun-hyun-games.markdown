While the utility of studying master games for weaker players is often
hotly debated among amateurs, I'm firmly in the the camp that believes
doing so cannot hurt your game. For all the profound reading present
in a professional game record, they also contain a multitude of moves
well within the grasp of anyone dedicated to the game. In the
engrossing Baduk novel
[First Kyu](http://senseis.xmp.net/?FirstKyuTheNovel) (which I'll talk
about in more detail in another post) Nak, a failed insei, tells Wook,
a talented player with professional aspirations, that theory and
tsumego books are for entertainment, and the game records of masters
are the real subject worthy of study. While I'm but a lowly single
digit kyu, I think there's a grain of truth here.

Unfortunately, as I've mentioned elsewhere, the pickings are somewhat
slim when it comes to game record collections with commentaries
in English. Fortunately what is available tends to be of
very high quality. If you've been playing Go since around AlphaGo
there's a fair chance you have
[Relentless](http://senseis.xmp.net/?Relentless) in your library. If
you've been playing Go for more than a year you might have heard
mention of
[Invincible: The Games of Shusaku](http://senseis.xmp.net/?Invincible)
in venerated tones. If you avidly follow contemporary Go,
[Lee Sedol's Commented Games](http://senseis.xmp.net/?CommentedGamesByLeeSedol)
may grace your collection. If you're a sucker for history like myself
there's little doubt a couple of John Fairbairn's [collected
commentaries on Go Seigen's](http://senseis.xmp.net/?KamakuraTheBook) [jubangos](http://senseis.xmp.net/?Jubango) reside upon your shelves.

But in all the commented game recommendations I have encountered online I
never once heard mentioned
[Cho Hun-hyun: Life and Master Games](http://senseis.xmp.net/?ChoHunhyunLifeAndMasterGames). A quick search on [Life in 19x19](http://lifein19x19.com)
brought up exactly one post about the book with no replies. The book
was originally published in Japan in 1995 with the title **So Kungen
Igo Meikyoku-Shu** as part of
a series covering contemporary masters from outside of Japan. Now that I
have this book in my possession, it feels like I've found a real
treasure and I'd like to describe it detail. While it's out of print
it shouldn't be too hard to get your hands on a used copy if you like
what you hear.

The book consists of twenty commented games. The first twelve are
from Cho's time as a newly minted professional of the Nihon Ki-in. The
later eight are from Cho's brilliant international career. Cho's
crowning achievement was defeating Nei Weiping in the very first
[Ing Cup](http://senseis.xmp.net/?IngCup). The Ing Cup is often to
referred to as the "Olympics" of Go due to it's occurrence only once
every four years. Cho returned to Korea from the Ing Cup a national
hero. This was after Cho had held *all* Korean titles *three* times
(1980, 1982, 1986). In fact, if not for the meteoric rise of his
student,
[Yi Ch'ang-ho (Lee Chang-ho, aka The Stone Bhudda)](http://senseis.xmp.net/?YiChangHo),
one can easily believe that Cho would have continued to accrue titles
in Korea and internationally for another decade.

In addition to the game commentary the book ends with some excellent
material describing the history as well as the then contemporary state
of Go in Korea (1990s). In the span of 50 years, top Korean players
went from needing to take two stones from visiting Japanese
professionals (also mentioned in First Kyu) to pretty much dominating
the international tournament circuit for two decades. For me, this book
is a critical missing puzzle piece in understanding how today's Go
came to be.

# The Life of Cho Hun-hyeon

<image width="400" style="float: left; margin-right: 1em; margin-bottom: 0.5em;"

Identified as a prodigy at young age, Cho was sent from Korea to Japan
to study with the best. Cho came under the tutelage of [Segoe
Kensaku](http://senseis.xmp.net/?SegoeKensaku). Yes, the very same Segoe Kensaku that took in a young Chinese
prodigy some thirty-five years earlier who later became known as Go
Seigen. For more information about that I highly recommend [Fairbairn's
Kamakura](http://senseis.xmp.net/?KamakuraTheBook).

After a steller performance in Japan, Cho had to return to Korea for
the mandatory military service. And after his service, unlike the
legendary [Cho Chikun](http://senseis.xmp.net/?ChoChikun), Cho
Hun-hyeon decided to stake his professional career in his
homeland. Perhaps, one could say that Cho Hun-hyeon in some ways fused
the deep lessons from Japan with the fighting spirit that
characterizes the Korean style? I don't have the qualifications to
make such a claim, but that's the general vibe I've ascertained so
far.

# The Games

In terms of commentary the style is more like Lee Sedol's commented
games. This gives the games a personal touch and a sense of drama
usually missing from third party commentary. Unlike Lee Sedol's book,
however, Cho doesn't drill down into a ton of variations. Like
Invincible, Cho only talks about a few critical things leaving much up
to the reader. To be honest, that's perfectly fine by me. My approach
to memorizing Go games is to replay them numerous times from start to
finish. Each time through the game I pick different points to pause
and enjoy the scenery, so to speak. This scenery appreciation usually
take the form of questions - why can't we cut? why is this sente? why
is this life and death? and so on.

I'll only mention the first two games as they are the only ones I got
around to studying in any depth so far.

For example, the first game in the book is young Cho Hun-hyeon against
a young player you've probably never heard of,
[Takemiya Masaki](http://senseis.xmp.net/?TakemiyaMasaki). It's an
Oteia Ranking Tournament game (you may recall this being referenced in
[Hikaru No Go](http://senseis.xmp.net/?HikaruNoGo)). After an overplay,
Cho loses control of the game but not without some spectacular
fireworks.

<p style="padding: 1em 0; margin: 0; font-size: 11px">
Abe (black) is in trouble!
</p>
</div>

The second game is between Cho and
[Abe Yoshiteru 9 dan](http://senseis.xmp.net/?AbeYoshiteru). Like the
[Shusaku Ear-Reddening game](http://senseis.xmp.net/?EarReddeningMove)
this is a tale of winning what appears to be a lost game. While it's
always inspiring to see raw power on display, it's the winning of that
lost game that's easiest to relate with. In Go, the value of patience
and tenacity cannot be undervalued.

The format of the commentaries is consistent. Cho always starts with a
description of the conditions of the game along with illuminating
stories that place the opponent in context with the greater flow of Go
at the time. Other notable opponents you'll encounter in this volume
include Kobayashi Koichi, Kato Masao, Nie Weiping, Rin Kaiho, and Yi
Ch'ang-ho.

# Go Seigen's Thoughts on Cho

The book ends with a series of brief but rich appendices.

The last appendix of the book is written by the editor of the Japanese
edition, Shirakawa Masayoshi. He describes the research done prior
to beginning the project. He spoke to many people to gain insight into
the kind of person and player that Cho Hun-hyeon was. The following
are excerpts from a series of interviews that occurred between the
editor and Go Seigen:

> **Shirakawa**: In Korea since the young genius Lee Changho has come to the
> fore, go has become tremendously popular, and in particular among
> children and teenagers there has been a go boom developing.
>
> The teacher of that young genius Lee Changho is Cho Hunhyun of
> course.
>
> **Go**: Right. Cho Hunhyun is a genius himself.

In a later interview about Go giving Cho a 2 stone teaching game when
the young Cho was 2 dan:

> **Shirakawa**: Previously you have described Cho Hunhyun as being
> a genius. May I ask what your impression of him was after playing
> that game?
>
> **Go**: His game was full of power and he had a good intuitive
> sense of the board. Genius level. His game contained no vestiges
> of the old style of playing.
