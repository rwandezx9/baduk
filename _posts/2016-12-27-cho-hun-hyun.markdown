[Cho Hun-hyeon's Sensei's Library entry](http://senseis.xmp.net/?ChoHunHyeon)
about a month ago I was surprised to see a volume of commented games
I'd never heard of before:
[Cho Hun-yun: Life and Master Games](http://senseis.xmp.net/?ChoHunhyunLifeAndMasterGames).
If you're an English speaker and you've been playing Go for more than
a year there's a pretty solid chance you've heard of
[Invincible: The Games of Shusaku](http://senseis.xmp.net/?Invincible). If
you follow contemporary Go there's a good chance that
[Lee Sedol's Commented Games](http://senseis.xmp.net/?CommentedGamesByLeeSedol)
appears in your collection. If you're a sucker for history like myself
there's little doubt you have a couple of John Fairbairn's collected
commentaries on Go Seigen's games. But in all the commented game
recommendations I'd encountered online I never once heard the Cho
Hun-hyeon book mentioned. A quick search on
[Life in 19x19](http://lifein19x19.com) brought up exactly one post
about the book with no replies. I suspect 

I found a relatively inexpensive copy in good condition on Amazon
and placed my order. A week later I had in my position I think any lover
of Go would appreciated.

Under pretty much any interpretation Cho Hun-hyeon is Go royalty. As
a young prodigy Cho Hun-hyeon was watched over by Segoe Kensaku. Yes,
the same Sego Kensaku that took that other young prodigy under his
wing some forty years earlier - Go Seigen.

The first half of the book covers Cho Hun-hyeon's experience as a
newly minted Japanese professional of the Nihon Ki-in.
