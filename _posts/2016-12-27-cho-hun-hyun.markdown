[Cho Hun-hyeon's Sensei's Library entry](http://senseis.xmp.net/?ChoHunHyeon)
about a month ago I was surprised to see a volume of commented games
I'd never heard of before:
[Cho Hun-yun: Life and Master Games](http://senseis.xmp.net/?ChoHunhyunLifeAndMasterGames).
Now if you're an English speaker and you've been playing Go since around
AlphaGo there's a fair chance you have
[Relentless](http://senseis.xmp.net/?Relentless) in your library. If
you've been playing Go for more than a year you might have heard
mention of
[Invincible: The Games of Shusaku](http://senseis.xmp.net/?Invincible)
in venerated tones. If you avidly follow contemporary Go,
[Lee Sedol's Commented Games](http://senseis.xmp.net/?CommentedGamesByLeeSedol)
may grace your collection. If you're a sucker for history like myself
there's little doubt a couple of John Fairbairn's collected
commentaries on Go Seigen's games reside upon your shelves. But in all
the commented game recommendations I'd encountered online I never once
heard the Cho Hun-hyeon book mentioned. A quick search on
[Life in 19x19](http://lifein19x19.com) brought up exactly one post
about the book with no replies. Now that I have this collection in my
possession, I'd like help correct this situation by describing this
wonderful book in detail.

The book consists of twenty of commented games. The first ten are from
Cho's time as a newly minted professional of the Nihon Ki-in. The
later half are from Cho's brilliant and dominating career in
Korea. Cho's crowning achievement was defeating Nei Weiping in the
very first Ing Cup, often to referred to the Olympics of Go due to
it's occurence only every four years. Cho returned from the Ing Cup a
national hero. If not for the meteoric rise of his student, Lee
Chang-ho, one can easily believe that Cho could have dominated the
game in Korea for another decade.

In addition to the game commentary the book ends with some excellent
material describing briefly the history and the contemporary state of
Go in Korea (1990s). In the span 50 years, top Korean players went
from taking two stones from Japanese professional to dominating the
international stage.

Identified as a prodigy at young age, Cho was sent from Korea to Japan
to study with the best. In then end, Cho was watched over by Segoe
Kensaku. Yes, the same Sego Kensaku that took in a young Chinese
prodigy some forty years earlier - Go Seigen.
