I had my second Yunguseng Dojang review on Thursday which I was
actually able to make this time around. I hoped In-seong might have
some positive things to say about my win. He started off the review
with *"many broken theory moves"*.

Wow. The whole review was an humbling eye-opener and I've already
watched it a second time thanks to the recorded video.

My baduk game has serious flaws which will need to be addressed if I
hope to improve. In short In-seong believed that my playing style was
unstable. He said to imagine assigning a rank to the quality of
each move played. On average a 7 kyu player will make 7 kyu
moves. Occasionally they might make moves that are up to 5 stones
stronger or down to 5 stones weaker, but on average their moves are 7
kyu moves. However, In-seong said my play demonstrated a much
wider variability of quality. This kind of variability leads to an unstable game
without a clear narrative. In his judgment the game should have been
over after I killed the lower left, but white not only was able to get
back in the game but in fact could have won if not for the missed life
and death situation in the lower right.

While he sympathized with the fact I played the latter half of the
game in byo-yomi, he pointed out that my instincts were often
wrong. What does this mean? It means my knowledge of fundamental
technique is full of holes. He suggested I spend more time on
*patterns*. Not life and death, not opening theory, not even
joseki. *Patterns*.

To be absolutely clear, In-seong's approach to criticism is direct, not
harsh. The best thing about having a teacher is that they can identify
your weaknesses and push you to address them. In-seong has done
exactly that.

He didn't give a specific suggestion with respect to studying
patterns, so I wondered the best way to go about it. Suddenly I
vaguely recalled browsing the preview of
[Cho Hun-hyeon's Lectures on Go Techniques](http://senseis.xmp.net/?ChoHunHyeonsLecturesOnGoTechniques)
available on SmartGo Books. I had decided it wasn't for me because it
seemed "too basic". These days I'm discovering again and again it's in
the fact the basics that I need to focus on. So I purchased both
volumes and started studying.

The book opens with with a couple pages of review on each of the following
topics:

* Surrounding and Escaping
* Connecting and Cutting
* Attachments
* Diagonals
* Tigers (Hangs)
* Empty Triangles
* Hanes at the Head of Opponent's Stones

A 7 kyu should know all this stuff right? And perhaps I do, but not
enough to be instinctual. For example, my last two games demonstrated
a consistent violation of "Cross-cut then extend". If you asked me in
person what I would do after a cross-cut, I would say extend. But if
you actually cross-cut my stones in a game I might very well atari or
maybe tenuki.

So I've swallowed my pride and thrown myself into really absorbing the
fundamental
patterns. [Cho Hun-hyeon's](http://senseis.xmp.net/?ChoHunHyeon) book
so far is exactly what I need. An inaccurate assessment of the book
would be that it's about the opening or joseki. This is not the
case. After the short and crystal clear review of fundamental
techniques the book contains 45 "problems" to demonstrate the correct
application of fundamental technique. Each answer consists of diagrams
of four or five incorrect solutions in addition to the correct
one. Yes nearly all the examples are in fact joseki, but the point is
that joseki arise from fundamental technique. Instead of memorizing
joseki the book pushes you to discover the joseki yourself through
fundamental technique.

As soon as I finish the book I intend to start over from the
beginning. I think four or five reads of this book are in my near
future.

My next American Yunguseng Dojang opponent is a KGS 4 kyu. This will
be a very tough game for me. While I may lose, I intend to play it
with better instincts. I'd much rather lose playing good moves than win
playing bad ones.
