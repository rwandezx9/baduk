When I first picked up playing Go about 14 years ago, I marveled at
the beauty of higher quality Japanese Go equipment on display at
online shops like [Kiseido](http://www.kiseido.com) and
[Kuroki Goishi Ten](http://kurokigoishi.co.jp)(KGT). But pragmatism
and the pocketbook conspired to ground such flights of fancy, so like
most budding enthusiasts, I started out with an inexpensive but
playable set. While I don't recall the exact details now, it was
likely a set composed of
[size 32 or 33 glass stones](http://senseis.xmp.net/?Goishi) with
plastic bowls and a beechwood board. Shortly thereafter I acquired as
a gift an older set comprised of a wooden folding board, a pair of
wooden bowls, and Chinese style flat slate and shell stones that were
in very bad shape. Unfortunately neither of these sets got much use
due to my lack of Go playing friends and my 15 kyu understanding of the
game simply didn't warrant more involved forms of study. A couple of
years later a move to New York and consequently more pressing life
goals took precedence over my hobby and I really didn't play at all
for a very long time and my sets collected dust.

Then somehow I found myself with a dream job working for the New York
Times which required a 40 minute daily commute to and from
Brooklyn. Suffice to say I blew through many novels but I also spent a
lot of time solving tsumego, playing 9x9 against the computer, and
reading my favorite Go books all thanks to
[SmartGo](https://www.smartgo.com). In the cramped space of a
metropolitan rush hour peering at a small screen, I remembered why I
had fallen in love with this game so many years ago.

While I still didn't have any Go playing friends, investing in a nicer
set felt like a kind of commitment or promise to myself.
[BenGoZen's excellent guide on caring for yunzi stones](http://bengozen.com/2010/10/07/how-to-oil-your-yunzi-stones/)
pushed me over the edge and I decided to go for a nice
[Yellow Mountain Imports](http://www.ymimports.com) set - size 33
double convex yunzi stones, mahogany bowls, and a 2.4 inch shin-kaya
board. This is a supremely playable set that has grown with my
deepening interest in the game; four years later I'm constantly using
it for reviewing commented games, studying joseki, investigating
haengma, and solving harder go problems. Also something called AlphaGo
and other recent serendipities means I now have a few Go playing
friends to meet over this rock solid set.

# My New Set

For some time I had said to myself I wouldn't purchase a high quality
set until I achieved shodan. But these days I no longer really see
shodan as a particularly interesting goal, that is, I now know that as
soon as I arrive I won't be satisfied and will be eager to reach yet
a higher level.

So when Kuroki Goishi announced a centenary special with various sets
at a steep 40% discount I made the leap. One week later I have in my
possession a work of art. The set came at a pretty steep price but
honestly I've spent more on laptop computers and as somebody who is
a technology professional, laptops are the kind of thing
you purchase once every two or three years. On the other hand this Go set far
surpasses the beauty of Johnny Ive designed hardware and it's more or
less guaranteed to last me the rest of my life.

# The Bowls

The bowls are XXL Hyuga Kaya bowls to accommodate the unusual size of
the stones. The grain is stunning and hopefully the photos communicate
some of that. The bowls, as with pretty much everything else, look
considerably more incredible in real life than the images I saw on the
KGT shop (or even the ones I've taken here).

# The Stones

The stones are size 41 (11.6mm) [Blue Label slate and shell
stones](http://shop.kurokigoishi.co.jp/en/category/15). They are *huge*, far larger than anything I've ever played
with before. Without a doubt my fingers will need to get used to
holding such large stones confidently. But even after just one day
they are growing on me and the aesthetic quality they bring to the
the board is sublime. These are Blue Label stones so they are
not particularly consistent with respect to grain. But that kind of
captures what I find most appealing about this set - while it's
gorgeous to behold it's not so gorgeous that I feel afraid to
play it. In fact quite the opposite, the heft and sheen of these
stones are constantly calling me out to work through just one more
game, just one more tsumego, or just one more haengma problem. The
surface of the goban already has the tell-tale dents of confidently
clicked stones and this is just as it should be.

# The Goban

I admit the board was the one part I was expecting to be somewhat
underwhelmed by - the images on KGT were a bit grainy and compared to
some of the other floor boards there this one appeared quite plain. But if
anything this speaks to the incredible level of Kuroki Goishi's
craft - the goban is just as beautiful as every other element of this set.

The goban shipped with a paulownia cover as well as a simple cloth
covering. The moment the paulownia cover came off my apartment filled
with the sweet scent of kaya. The board itself is far more golden than
the KGT shop pictures let on, and as expected the lines of the board are
raised and I assume they were made with the same samurai sword
technique as shown in the [various KGT youtube videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex-4gaaMcQM).

I was somewhat concerned about the height of the board but after
reviewing a Go Seigen game and a Shusaku game for about an hour and a
half and I didn't feel particularly fatigued from looking down at the
board.

The experience of interacting with Kuroki Goishi was stellar and
delightfully straightforward. Everything was expertly packed into one
large box and none of the items show any sign of damage during the
trip from Hyuga to Brooklyn.

While I don't think I'll be making any more serious purchases from
them anytime in the near future the whole experience was incredibly
positive and I feel like I've acquired a genuine piece of art. In the
same way a great guitar demands to be played, this set also demands to
be played and I will be more than happy to oblige for years to come.
