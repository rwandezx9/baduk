I walked into a NYC Koreatown bookstore the other day wondering if
they had a section dedicated to Baduk. Lo and behold there was about
half a shelf of interesting looking Baduk technique books. There was a
nice looking hardcover which turned out to be a collection of
[Lee Chang-ho (aka The Stone Bhudda)](http://senseis.xmp.net/?YiChangHo)
title match games! I couldn't resist of course and picked it up.

I've been slowly teaching myself
[Hangul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangul) so this is another
excuse to push myself a bit harder.
